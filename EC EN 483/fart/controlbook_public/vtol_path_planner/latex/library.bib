	abstract = {Doppler processing was the principle of operation for the first satellite navigation system, Transit, that became operational in 1964 and was phased-out in 1996 [1]. Its successor, the Global Positioning System (GPS) uses the principle of one-way ranging, which requires fewer satellites for a position solution compared to Doppler processing [2]. In recent years, Doppler processing has been revisited for several applications, including precise velocity [3]; positioning with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites using carrier Doppler shift only [4]; combining signal-ofopportunity Doppler measurements from multiple LEO satellite constellations [5]; and solutions combining both pseudorange and Doppler measurements [6]. This paper summarizes different Doppler processing techniques, performance as a function of geometry and error sources, and provides results for several examples ranging from computer models to actual observations from static and dynamic users.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous trajectory estimation and mapping (STEAM) offers an efficient approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, by representing the trajectory as a Gaussian process (GP). Previous formulations of the STEAM framework use a GP prior that assumes white-noise-on-acceleration, with the prior mean encouraging constant body-centric velocity. We show that such a prior cannot sufficiently represent trajectory sections with nonzero acceleration, resulting in a bias to the posterior estimates. This letter derives a novel motion prior that assumes white-noise-on-jerk, where the prior mean encourages constant body-centric acceleration. With the new prior, we formulate a variation of STEAM that estimates the pose, body-centric velocity, and body-centric acceleration. By evaluating across several datasets, we show that the new prior greatly outperforms the white-noise-on-acceleration prior in terms of the solution accuracy.},

	abstract = {Abstract--- To be applicable to real world scenarios trajectory planning schemes for mobile autonomous systems must be able to efficiently deal with obstacles in the area of operation. In the context of optimization based trajectory planning and control a number of different approaches to formulate collision avoidance constraints can be found in the literature. This work presents a novel formulation building on constructive solid geometry (CSG) to describe collision avoidance constraints. It is highly efficient due to a very low number of nonlinear inequality constraints required for a given number of obstacles and sample points and in contrast to the original CSG formulation allows to consider the controlled system's shape. To allow for a comparison, popular methods to represent obstacles from the literature are summarized and characterized, namely the simple ellipsoidal representation, the original CSG method as well as a direct and an indirect implementation of a signed distance based approach. A benchmark example shows the good performance of the proposed formulation. Here, optimal trajectory planning for marine surface vessels formulated as a nonlinear programming problem is used, where the scenario is designed based on the maritime test field in Kiel, Germany.},

Classical path-planning algorithms in artificial intelligence are not designed to deal with wide continuous environments prone to currents. We present a novel Fast Marching (FM)-based approach to address the following issues. First, we develop an algorithm we call FM* to efficiently extract a 2-D continuous path from a discrete representation of the environment. Second, we take underwater currents into account thanks to an anisotropic extension of the original FM algorithm. Third, the vehicle turning radius is introduced as a constraint on the optimal path curvature for both isotropic and anisotropic media. Finally, a multiresolution method is introduced to speed up the overall path-planning process.},

	abstract = {Abstract--- This paper presents a method for planning nearoptimal collision-free path between two pre-specified points with given orientations for nonholonomic flying robots or UAVs navigating in a 3D space amid obstacles. The proposed method is based on the Fast Marching Method (FMM), which uses a first order numerical approximation of the Eikonal equation. The FMM is combined with average filter, B-spline functions and a new tool called Virtual Obstacle to guarantee smoothness of the produced path. The Virtual Obstacle is in the form of a torus to adjust the path with orientation of the flying robot at the start and goal points. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can find near-optimal paths with maximum curvatures less than the robot's minimum flying radius.},

	abstract = {Abstract--- In this paper, we propose a framework for online quadrotor motion planning for autonomous navigation in unknown environments. Based on the onboard state estimation and environment perception, we adopt a fast marching-based path searching method to find a path on a velocity field induced by the Euclidean signed distance field (ESDF) of the map, to achieve better time allocation. We generate a flight corridor for the quadrotor to travel through by inflating the path against the environment. We represent the trajectory as piecewise B´ezier curves by using Bernstein polynomial basis and formulate the trajectory generation problem as typical convex programs. By using B´ezier curves, we are able to bound positions and higher order dynamics of the trajectory entirely within safe regions. The proposed motion planning method is integrated into a customized light-weight quadrotor platform and is validated by presenting fully autonomous navigation in unknown cluttered indoor and outdoor environments. We also release our code for trajectory generation as an open-source package.},

Performance of MTT-SE(3) is verified in hardware by simultaneously tracking three multirotors using a stationary monocular camera.

	abstract = {Abstract---Continuous-time estimation using splines on Lie groups has been gaining traction in the literature due to the ability to incorporate high-frequency sensor data without introducing newoptimizationparameters.However,evaluatingtimederivatives and Jacobians of Lie group splines is computationally expensive, limiting their use mainly to offline applications. Motivated by the trajectory planning literature, we develop a new estimation technique that leverages the differential flatness property of many dynamic systems to define the spline in the system's flat output space, which is often Euclidean. Doing so has the added benefit of providing a simple and effective way to include system inputs in the estimation process. We show an example of flatness-based estimation for the unicycle dynamic model. We then show that this new method can achieve similar performance as Lie group spline estimation with significantly less computation time, and validate its use in hardware using a differential-drive robot.},

	abstract = {Abstract---In this paper, we revisit batch state estimation through the lens of Gaussian process (GP) regression. We consider continuous-discrete estimation problems wherein a trajectory is viewed as a one-dimensional GP, with time as the independent variable. Our continuous-time prior can be defined by any linear, time-varying stochastic differential equation driven by white noise; this allows the possibility of smoothing our trajectory estimates using a variety of vehicle dynamics models (e.g., `constant-velocity'). We show that this class of prior results in an inverse kernel matrix (i.e., covariance matrix between all pairs of measurement times) that is exactly sparse (block-tridiagonal) and that this can be exploited to carry out GP regression (and interpolation) very efficiently. Though the prior is continuous, we consider measurements to occur at discrete times. When the measurement model is also linear, this GP approach is equivalent to classical, discrete-time smoothing (at the measurement times). When the measurement model is nonlinear, we iterate over the whole trajectory (as is common in vision and robotics) to maximize accuracy. We test the approach experimentally on a simultaneous trajectory estimation and mapping problem using a mobile robot dataset.},

	abstract = {Abstract--- Safe control for inherently unstable systems such as quadrotors is crucial. Imposing multiple dynamic constraints simultaneously on the system states for safety regulation can be a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a quadratic programming (QP) based approach on a cascaded control architecture for quadrotors to enforce safety. Safety regions are constructed using control barrier functions (CBF) while explicitly considering the nonlinear underactuated dynamics of the quadrotor. The safety regions constructed using CBFs establish a non-conservative forward invariant safe region for quadrotor navigation. Barriers imposed across the cascaded architecture allow independent safety regulation in the quadrotor's altitude and lateral domains. Despite barriers appearing in a cascaded fashion, we show preservation of safety for quadrotor motion in SE(3). We demonstrate the feasibility of our method on a quadrotor in simulation with static and dynamic constraints enforced on the position and velocity spaces simultaneously.},

While numerous techniques have been developed, the three most widely used approaches to MTT are the joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT), and random finite set (RFS). The JPDAF and MHT have been widely used for more than two decades, while the RFS-based MTT algorithms have received a great deal of attention during the last decade.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT | Situation-aware technologies enabled by multitarget tracking will lead to new services and applications in fields such as autonomous driving, indoor localization, robotic networks, and crowd counting. In this tutorial paper, we advocate a recently proposed paradigm for scalable multitarget tracking that is based on message passing or, more concretely, the loopy sum�product algorithm. This approach has advantages regarding estimation accuracy, computational complexity, and implementation flexibility. Most importantly, it provides a highly effective, efficient, and scalable solution to the probabilistic data association problem, a major challenge in multitarget tracking. This fact makes it attractive for emerging applications requiring real-time operation on resource-limited devices. In addition, the message passing approach is intuitively appealing and suited to nonlinear and non-Gaussian models.  We present message-passing-based multitarget tracking methods for single-sensor and multiple-sensor scenarios, and for a known and unknown number of targets. The presented methods can cope with clutter, missed detections, and an unknown association between targets and measurements. We also discuss the integration of message-passingbased probabilistic data association into existing multitarget tracking methods. The superior performance, low complexity, and attractive scaling properties of the presented methods are verified numerically. In addition to simulated data, we use measured data captured by two radar stations with overlapping fields-of-view observing a large number of targets simultaneously.},

	abstract = {In tracking targets with less-than-unity probability of detection in the presence of false alarms (FAs), data association---deciding which of the received multiple measurements to use to update each track---is crucial. Most algorithms that make a hard decision on the origin of the true measurement begin to fail as the FA rate increases or with low observable (low probability of target detection) maneuvering targets. Instead of using only one measurement among the received ones and discarding the others, an alternative approach is to use all of the validated measurements with different weights (probabilities), known as probabilistic data association (PDA).

This paper presents an overview of the PDA technique and its application for different target tracking scenarios. First, it describes the use of the PDA technique for tracking low observable targets with passive sonar measurements. This target motion analysis is an application of the PDA technique, in conjunction with the maximum-likelihood approach, for target motion parameter estimation via a batch procedure. Then, the PDA technique for tracking highly maneuvering targets and for radar resource management is illustrated with recursive state estimation using the interacting multiple model estimator combined with PDA. Finally, a sliding window (which can also expand and contract) parameter estimator using the PDA approach for tracking the state of a maneuvering target using measurements from an electrooptical sensor is presented.},

	abstract = {This article presents a generic motion model to capture mobile robots' dynamic behaviors (translation and rotation). The model is based on statistical models driven by white random processes and is formulated into a full state estimation algorithm based on the error-state extended Kalman filtering framework (ESEKF). The major benefits of this method are its versatility, being applicable to different robotic systems without accurately modeling the robots' specific dynamics, and the ability to estimate the robot's (angular) acceleration, jerk, or higher order dynamic states with low delay. Mathematical analyses with numerical simulations are presented to show the properties of the statistical model-based estimation framework and reveal its connection to existing low-pass filters. Furthermore, a new paradigm is developed for robotic observability analysis by developing Lie derivatives and associated partial differentiation directly on manifolds. It is shown that this new paradigm is much simpler and more natural than existing methods based on quaternion parameterizations. It is also scalable to highdimensional systems. A novel thin set concept is introduced to characterize the unobservable subset of the system states, providing the theoretical foundation to observability analysis of robotic systems operating on manifolds and in high dimension. Finally, extensive experiments, including full state estimation and extrinsic calibration (both POS-IMU and IMU-IMU) on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a handheld platform, and a ground vehicle, are conducted. Comparisons with existing methods show that the proposed method can effectively estimate all extrinsic parameters, the robot's translation/angular acceleration, and other state variables (e.g., position, velocity, and attitude) with high accuracy and low delay.},

Novelty, taking the influence of parameters on the cooperative guidance results into account, an adaptive weight function is designed to replace the traditional constant coefficient to optimize guidance results. Then, the motion of vehicle in three-dimensional space is divided into two planes, the proportional navigation guidance (PNG) is applied in longitudinal and the lateral acceleration can be obtained via the finite-time controller and longitudinal acceleration. It is significant to establish the lateral leading angle finite-time convergence guidance law to compensate the lateral acceleration to accelerate the convergence speed. Furthermore, the biased term of terminal impact angle control is applied in PNG to achieve the terminal attack in arbitrary angle. Finally, the feasibility and robustness are verified by numerical simulations.},

This paper mainly cares about the coordination of the entry glide flight phase and driving-down phase. Different from the existing results, both the attack time and the attack angle constraints are considered simultaneously. Firstly, for the entry glide flight phase, a two-stage method is proposed to achieve the rapid cooperative trajectories planning, where the control signal corridors are designed based on the quasi-equilibrium gliding conditions. In the first stage, the bank angle curve is optimized to achieve the attack angle coordination. In the second stage, the angle of attack curve is optimized to achieve the attack time coordination. The optimized parameters can be obtained by the secant method. Secondly, for the driving-down phase, the cooperative terminal guidance law is designed where the terminal attack time and attack angle are considered. The guidance law is then transformed into the bank angle and angle of attack commands. The cooperative guidance strategy is summarized as an algorithm. Finally, a numerical simulation example with three hypersonic gliding vehicles is provided for revealing the effectiveness of the acquired strategy and algorithm.

The traditional reentry trajectory planning and guidance algorithm is difficult to satisfy terminal constraints and coordinated flight time simultaneously. Especially, the terminal accuracy will be greatly reduced when the target point changes online. To solve this problem, an online trajectory planning and guidance method based on sequential convex programming is proposed. Firstly, several waypoints are selected from the initial trajectory of the vehicles, and the cooperative time is updated at each waypoint according to the information of the target point and other members in the cluster. By using the concept of receding horizon control, the cooperative trajectory is reconstructed rapidly by the sequential convex programming algorithm. During the flight, the linear quadratic control method is utilized to track the trajectory planning results. Taking a reentry cluster including three common aero vehicles as an example, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. The simulation results show that the method can adapt to the online change of the target point, and ensure that the multi-hypersonic glide vehicles can reach the target point simultaneously under multi-constraints.},

This paper presents theoretically justified controllers that use relative range and bearing measurements to steer a team of autonomous vehicles, operating without inertial position information, to circular trajectories around a constant-acceleration, constant-velocity, or stationary target. An extended Kalman filter is used to improve the noisy relative measurements and estimate the velocity of the moving target. These estimated values are used in the control laws to encircle constant-velocity moving targets. Lyapunov techniques are utilized to show that the vehicle will converge to the desired circular formations. Additionally, cooperating vehicles are shown to converge to a circular formation with equal temporal spacing using each vehicle's estimate of the target's velocity to define a common reference frame. Numerical simulations validate the efficacy of these control laws.},

The strategy presented here encodes the probability of points in space to be occupied using 2.5D Bspline surfaces. For a fast update rate, the surface is recursively updated as new measurements arrive. The proposed B-spline map is less susceptible to precision and interpolation errors that are present in occupancy grid-based methods. From simulation and experimental results, we show that this approach leverages the floating point resolution of continuous metric maps and the fast update/access/merging advantages of discrete metric maps. Thus, the proposed method is suitable for online robotic tasks such as localization and path planning, requiring minor modification to existing software that usually operates on metric maps.},

There are two classes of occupancy mapping problems that we particularly investigate. The first problem is related to mapping under pose uncertainty and how to propagate pose estimation uncertainty into the map inference. We develop expected kernel and expected submap notions to deal with uncertain inputs. In the second problem, we account for the complication of the robot's perception noise using warped Gaussian processes (WGPs). This approach allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy mapping problem. According to our experimental results, although taking into account pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by modeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs improve the map quality.},

	abstract = {Abstract---Winged eVTOL aircraft's ability to generate aerodynamic lift with wings and to create upward thrust with upward-facing rotors makes these vehicles capable of the kind of versatile flight needed in urban environments. Because of these vehicles' aerodynamic complexities and their unique methods of producing thrusts and torques, control allocation is needed to determine how to distribute force and torque efforts across the aircraft's actuators. However, current control allocation methods fail to properly represent the actuators' complex dynamics and are unable to harness the full potential of these over-actuated vehicles. Current shortcomings include modeling rotors as linear effectors while the wide range of airspeeds experienced by eVTOL aircraft leads to significant nonlinearities in the thrust and torque achieved by each rotor. This means linear control allocation methods may consistently fail to produce desired thrusts and torques, which can inhibit the vehicle from tracking a trajectory at best, and at worst can cause the vehicle to stall and lose control. Additionally, current control allocation methods are often unable to prioritize low-energy actuators resulting in shorter battery life. We present a nonlinear control allocation method that considers a nonlinear rotor model, allows for prioritization of low-energy control surfaces over rotors, and reliably accounts for actuator saturation. Simulation results show a 90% reduction in high-airspeed trajectory tracking position error from a typical, linear least-squares pseudoinverse control allocation method while maintaining comparable energy use.},

	abstract = {Agile fixed-wing aircraft integrate the efficient, high-speed capabilities of conventional fixed-wing platforms with the extreme maneuverability of rotorcraft. This work presents a nonlinear control strategy that harnesses these capabilities to enable autonomous flight through aggressive, time-constrained, three-dimensional trajectories. The cascaded control structure consists of two parts; an inner attitude control loop developed on the Special Orthornormal group that avoids singularities commonly associated with other parametrizations, and an outer position control loop that jointly determines the thrust command and attitude references by implementing a novel vector-projection algorithm. The objective of the algorithm is to decouple roll from the reference attitude to ensure that thrust and lift forces can always be pointed such that position errors converge to zero. The proposed control system represents a single, unified solution that remains effective throughout the aircraft's flight envelope, including aerobatic operation. Controller performance is verified through simulations and experimental flight tests; results show the unified control scheme is capable of performing a wide range of operations that would normally require multiple, single-purpose controllers, and their associated switching logic.},

This article presents an overview of the techniques and methods required to develop a linear covariance analysis tool for a close-loop GN&C system. Then, using a simple nonlinear closed-loop GN&C problem as a guide, the capabilities of linear covariance analysis for the design and analysis of closed-loop systems are demonstrated. It is shown that linear covariance can be accurately applied to a closedloop system with time-to-go guidance, dead-reckoning navigation, and a Kalman filter for state estimation. The accuracy and efficiency of linear covariance analysis is shown by direct comparison to Monte Carlo analysis results, and the value of linear covariance analysis is highlighted by presenting several analysis capabilities that are often required in the design and analysis of closed-loop GN&C systems. It is also shown how the efficiency of linear covariance enables new design methodologies, one of which is presented in this article, that would otherwise be prohibitive with Monte Carlo analysis.},

The basic idea is to create a truth model with state x, a navigation solution with state xhat, a closed-loop controller that acts on xhat, and then to write the linear covariance update equations about a nominal trajectory and to propagate the covariance equations using Kalman filter equations on the full state (x, xhat).  

The lincov method can be used to perform a variety of tradestudies and analysis.  

I am wondering if it can be adapted to provide quick evaluation of uncertainty along different trajectories.

The proposed if system expands the autonomous capabilities the platform by allowing an independent roll command to be prescribed while still ensuring the UAV follows the intended path. This controller is built around a geometric attitude control system, a rolldecoupling velocity control, and a guidance law that steers the UAV onto the intended path through velocity commands.

Results show the versatility of the control system, since arbitrary roll maneuvers can be achieved without additional aerodynamic characterization.},

An approach to combining the static and dynamic elements is provided that ensures closed-loop stability, yet with the structure of the static compensator preserved. The work is motivated by the need to stabilize quadcopters subject to large disturbances, and excerpts from an extensive simulation campaign are reported.

	abstract = {Abstract---This letter considers the rigid body attitude stabilization problem with actuator saturation. This problem has been considered in the literature before, but most approaches achieve stability at the expense of strict constraints on the control gains, thereby limiting small-signal performance. The approach proposed here removes the constraints on the gains of the nominal controller and instead deals with the control constraints through an antiwindup mechanism, effectively allowing for more freedom in small signal behavior whilst preserving stability in the large. Although the rigid body stabilization problem is inherently nonlinear, the spirit of the results developed here resemble constrained-control results for linear systems containing imaginary axis poles, despite some subtle differences which need careful consideration.},

	abstract = {Abstract---This paper investigates the global tracking control of underactuated aerial vehicles. In particular, the globally exponentially stable attitude tracking controller serving as the inner loop of the overall controller is investigated. It can avoid the common problems that may be accompanied by other attitude controllers, such as singularity and unwinding. In order to overcome the topological obstacles of global control on SO(3), rotational motion of a rigid body is expressed in the exponential coordinate restricted in a compact domain. We then construct a hybrid tracking error dynamics whose states are all represented in Euclidean space. The geometric properties of the state space are mathematically analyzed. The tracking controller of underactuated aerial vehicles is, thus, designed based on the hybrid tracking error dynamics. The global exponential stability of the closed-loop attitude subsystem, as well as the global asymptotical stability of the closed-loop overall system under assumptions, is analyzed using Lyapunov's method strictly. These properties are demonstrated by simulation results. The proposed controller is also implemented and tested on our self-developed quadrotor, showing the feasibility of the controller in realtime applications.},
	annote = {This is a very nice paper that shows global stability for both the attitude and the trajectory tracking control for a multi-rotor system.  

We should build off of these results.

The dynamics are modeled using hybrid system theory.  The control is shown to be stable by showing that the Lyapunov function decreases off of the switching manifold, and then decreases during finite jumps.

The Lyapunov function uses the logarithmic map, similar to Jake Johnson's approach.

	abstract = {Multiple-target tracking algorithms generally operate in the local frame of the sensor and have difficulty with track reallocation when targets move in and out of the sensor field-ofview. This poses a problem when an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is tracking multiple ground targets on a road network larger than its field-of-view. To address this problem, we propose a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) to maintain individual target tracks and to perform probabilistic data association when the targets are constrained to a road network. This is particularly useful when a target leaves and then re-enters the UAV's fieldof-view. The RBPF is structured as a particle filter of particle filters. The top level filter handles data association and each of its particles maintains a bank of particle filters to handle target tracking. The tracking particle filters incorporate both positive and negative information when a measurement is received. We implement two path planning controllers, receding horizon and deep reinforcement learning, and compare their ability to improve the certainty for multiple target location estimates. The controllers prioritize paths that reduce each target's entropy. In addition, we develop an algorithm that computes the upper bound on the filter's performance, thus facilitating an estimate of the number of UAVs needed to achieve a desired performance threshold.},

By selecting an attitude error function carefully, we show that the proposed control system guarantees a desirable tracking performance uniformly for nontrivial rotational maneuvers involving a large initial attitude error. In a special case where the desired attitude command is fixed, we also show that the attitude dynamics can be stabilized without the knowledge of an inertia matrix.

	abstract = {Reliable scene analysis, under varying conditions, is an essential task in nearly any assistance or autonomous system application, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are no exception. ADAS commonly involve adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, lane change assistance, traffic sign recognition, and parking assistance---with the ultimate goal of producing a fully autonomous vehicle. The present paper addresses detection and tracking of moving objects within the context of ADAS. We use a multisensor setup consisting of a radar and a stereo camera mounted on top of a vehicle. We propose to model the sensors uncertainty in polar coordinates on Lie Groups and perform the objects state filtering on Lie groups, specifically, on the product of two special Euclidean groups, i.e., SE(2) 2 . To this end, we derive the designed filter within the framework of the extended Kalman filter on Lie groups. We assert that the proposed approach results with more accurate uncertainty modeling, since used sensors exhibit contrasting measurement uncertainty characteristics and the predicted target motions result with banana-shaped uncertainty contours. We believe that accurate uncertainty modeling is an important ADAS topic, especially when safety applications are concerned. To solve the multitarget tracking problem, we use the joint integrated probabilistic data association filter and present necessary modifications in order to use it on Lie groups. The proposed approach is tested on a real-world dataset collected with the described multisensor setup in urban traffic scenarios.},

	abstract = {Abstract--- Current control methods for winged eVTOL UAVs consider the vehicle primarily as a fixed-wing aircraft with the addition of vertical thrust used only during takeoff and landing. These methods provide good long-range flight handling but fail to consider the full dynamics of the vehicle for tracking complex trajectories. We present a trajectory tracking controller for the full dynamics of a winged eVTOL UAV in hover, fixed-wing, and partially transitioned flight scenarios. We show that in lowto moderate-speed flight, trajectory tracking can be achieved using a variety of pitch angles. In these conditions, the pitch of the vehicle is a free variable which we use to minimize the necessary thrust, and therefore energy consumption, of the vehicle. We use a geometric attitude controller and an airspeeddependent control allocation scheme to operate the vehicle at a wide range of airspeeds, flight path angles, and angles of attack. We provide simulation results and theoretical guarantees for the stability of the proposed control scheme assuming a standard aerodynamic model.},

	abstract = {Trajectory tracking control for winged eVTOL aircraft is complicated by the high-angle-of-attack aerodynamics experienced during navigational flight occurring immediately after takeoff and immediately before landing.
The total energy use of the vehicle can be reduced and the control performance can be improved by appropriately considering the pitch angle of the vehicle in varying flight conditions.
We present a review of high-angle-of-attack aerodynamic models as well as an algorithm for finding the optimal pitch and thrust of a winged eVTOL throughout its flight regime.
We show simulation results demonstrating a 75\% reduction in tracking error over our previous work while maintaining a similar average thrust and an 85\% reduction in tracking error over using a multirotor-like controller.  The results show that the method is robust to modeling error in the stall characteristics.},

Joint events are formed by creating all possible combinations of track-measurement assignments and the probabilities for these joint events are calculated. The expressions for the joint event probabilities incorporate the probabilities of target existence of individual tracks, an efficient approximation for the cluster volume and a priori probability of the number of clutter measurements in each cluster. From these probabilities the data association and target existence probabilities of individual tracks are obtained, which allows track state update and false track discrimination.

	abstract = {Snmmnry--This paper presents a new approach to the problem of tracking when the source of the measurement data is uncertain. It is assumed that one object of interest ('target') is in track and a number of undesired returns are detected and resolved at a certain time in the neighbourhood of the predicted location of the target's return. A suboptimal estimation procedure that takes into account all the measurements that might have originated from the object in track but does not have growing memory and computational requirements is presented. The probability of each return 0ying in a certain neighborhood of the predicted return, called 'validation region') being correct is obtained--this is called 'probabilistic data association' (PDA). The undesired returns are assumed uniformly and independently distributed. The estimation is done by using the PDA method with an appropriately modified tracking filter, called PDAF. Since the computational requirements of the PDAF are only slightly higher than those of the standard filter, the method can be useful for real-time systems. Simulation results obtained for tracking an object in a cluttered environment show the PDAF to give significantly better results than the standard filter currently in use for this type of problem.},

	abstract = {Abstract--- In this paper, we consider a trajectory planning problem where an autonomous vehicle aims to rendezvous with another cooperating vehicle in minimum time. The first vehicle has kinematic constraints, consequently feasible trajectories must have a maximum curvature less than a specified limit. Rendezvous is said to occur at the instant that the two vehicles are collocated with the same heading. We propose a technique to construct a trajectory, composed of piecewise quadratic B´ezier curves, that satisfies the vehicle motion constraints and achieves rendezvous in minimum time. The methodology begins by finding safe flight corridors, which are constructed from sequences of triangles using constrained Delaunay triangulation of the feasible space; the triangles define the bounds of B´ezier curves. We formulate the necessary constraints for continuity and feasibility as functions of the control points that define the B´ezier curves, and the resulting optimization problem is solved using a nonlinear programming solver. The techniques developed were tested using simulated scenarios, and we present the results which highlight the efficacy of the proposed solution approach. Furthermore, the algorithm was implemented and tested in a field test and those results are presented.

	abstract = {Outer polyhedral representations of a given polynomial curve are extensively exploited in computer graphics rendering, computer gaming, path planning for robots, and ￿nite element simulations. B{\'e}zier curves (which use the Bernstein basis) or B-Splines are a very common choice for these polyhedral representations because their non-negativity and partition-of-unity properties guarantee that each interval of the curve is contained inside the convex hull of its control points. However, the convex hull provided by these bases is not the one with smallest volume, producing therefore undesirable levels of conservatism in all of the applications mentioned above. This paper presents the MINVO basis, a polynomial basis that generates the smallest =-simplex that encloses any given = th -order polynomial curve. The results obtained for = = 3 show that, for any given 3 rd -order polynomial curve, the MINVO basis is able to obtain an enclosing simplex whose volume is 2.36 and 254.9 times smaller than the ones obtained by the Bernstein and B-Spline bases, respectively. When = = 7, these ratios increase to 902.7 and 2.997 · 10 21 , respectively. Moreover, we show that the MINVO basis also solves for the = th -order polynomial curve with the largest convex hull enclosed in any given =-simplex. Global optimality is discussed and proven for = = 1, 2, 3 using Sum-Of-Squares (SOS) Programming, branch and bound, and moment relaxations.},

The library goes beyond existing visual and visual-inertial SLAM libraries (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINSMono, OKVIS, ROVIO) by enabling mesh reconstruction and semantic labeling in 3D. Kimera is designed with modularity in mind and has four key components: a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) module for fast and accurate state estimation, a robust pose graph optimizer for global trajectory estimation, a lightweight 3D mesher module for fast mesh reconstruction, and a dense 3D metric-semantic reconstruction module. The modules can be run in isolation or in combination, hence Kimera can easily fall back to a state-of-the-art VIO or a full SLAM system. Kimera runs in real-time on a CPU and produces a 3D metric-semantic mesh from semantically labeled images, which can be obtained by modern deep learning methods. We hope that the flexibility, computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy afforded by Kimera will build a solid basis for future metric-semantic SLAM and perception research, and will allow researchers across multiple areas (e.g., VIO, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, segmentation) to benchmark and prototype their own efforts without having to start from scratch.},

	abstract = {Compared to the optimal track-to-track fusion (T2TF) algorithm under linear Gaussian assumption and the information matrix fusion, the major advantage of the covariance intersection (CI) method for the problem of T2TF is that it neither needs the crosscovariances between the local tracks, nor does it use local information increments which are required to be independent. This allows the CI method to be used in scenarios where the optimal T2TF and the information matrix fusion algorithms are difficult or impractical to implement. However, a significant drawback of the original CI algorithm is that it is too conservative and will yield unnecessary loss in its calculated fusion accuracy. Even worse, as shown in this paper, this loss increases with the number of local tracks for fusion. This greatly degrades the usefulness of the CI algorithm. In this paper, a new ``sampling CI'' algorithm is proposed, which is simple to implement and does not have the above problematic feature of the original CI. Simulation results from various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

	abstract = {We consider the continuous-time Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR) problem in terms of optimizing a real-valued matrix function over the set of feedback gains. The results developed are in parallel to those in Bu et al. [1] for discrete-time LTI systems. In this direction, we characterize several analytical properties (smoothness, coerciveness, quadratic growth) that are crucial in the analysis of gradient-based algorithms. We also point out similarities and distinctive features of the continuous time setup in comparison with its discrete time analog. First, we examine three types of well-posed flows direct policy update for LQR: gradient flow, natural gradient flow and the quasi-Newton flow. The coercive property of the corresponding cost function suggests that these flows admit unique solutions while the gradient dominated property indicates that the underling Lyapunov functionals decay at an exponential rate; quadratic growth on the other hand guarantees that the trajectories of these flows are exponentially stable in the sense of Lyapunov. We then discuss the forward Euler discretization of these flows, realized as gradient descent, natural gradient descent and quasi-Newton iteration. We present stepsize criteria for gradient descent and natural gradient descent, guaranteeing that both algorithms converge linearly to the global optima. An optimal stepsize for the quasi-Newton iteration is also proposed, guaranteeing a Q-quadratic convergence rate--and in the meantime--recovering the Kleinman-Newton iteration. Lastly, we examine LQR state feedback synthesis with a sparsity pattern. In this case, we develop the necessary formalism and insights for projected gradient descent, allowing us to guarantee a sublinear rate of convergence to a first-order stationary point.},

	abstract = {Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft take advantage of distributed electric propulsion as well as aerodynamic lifting surfaces to take off vertically and perform long-duration flights. Complex aerodynamic interactions and a hard-to-predict transition maneuver from hover to wing-borne flight are one challenge in their development. To address this, we compare three different interaction models of varying fidelity for optimizing the transition trajectory of a biplane tailsitter. The first model accounts for simplified rotor-on-wing interactions using momentum theory, while the other two account for wing-on-wing interactions using a vortex lattice method and rotor-on-wing aerodynamic interactions using blade element momentum theory. One includes the swirl component of velocity and the other neglects swirl. To determine the trajectory, we perform direct collocation on the lowest fidelity model using gradient-based optimization. To compare them, we use the same control inputs obtained in the optimization to integrate trajectories using the higher fidelity models. We find that the higher fidelity models predict power and stall significantly more conservatively than the lowest fidelity model, making a case for their usefulness in trajectory optimization.

	abstract = {Abstract: We describe a trajectory optimization framework that maximizes observability of one or more user-chosen states in a nonlinear system. Our framework is based on a novel metric for quality of observability that is state-estimator agnostic and offers improved numerical stability over prior methods in some cases where the states of interest do not appear directly in the observation. We apply this metric to trajectory optimization problems for closed-loop self-calibration, maintaining observability while navigating through an environment, and rapidly modifying an already-planned trajectory for online recalibration. We include a statistical procedure to balance observability of several states with heterogeneous units and magnitudes. As an example, we apply our framework to online calibration of GPS--IMU and visual--inertial navigation systems on a quadrotor helicopter. Extensive simulations and a real-robot experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showing better convergence of the states and the resulting higher precision in navigation.

They use traditional polynomial splines with the null space to parametrize extra degrees of freedom.  They also use Bezier curves to do collision free trajectory planning.  The second interesting aspect of this paper is the cost function used for optimizing is designed to enhance observability of the system.   The main idea is that they maximize the minimum singular value of a matrix that approximates the local observability Grammian.  Unfortunately they argue that the cost function is not monotonic or submodular and therefore is difficult to optimize numerically.  Simulation and experimental results show that the method enhances the estimation properties via the motion of the system.  },

To address this problem, this paper investigates the effectiveness of a forward-in-time Riccati-based control law. This approach is motivated by the fact that the optimal state estimator is based on a forward-in-time Riccati-based solution that does not require advance knowledge of the system dynamics. In this paper we show that a forward-in-time Riccati-based control law stabilizes the system if the dynamics of the quasi-dual system are asymptotically stable. This property holds if the closedloop dynamics are symmetric, and, for some plants, is achieved by dynamics with sufficiently fast time variation. In addition, using a separation principal type result, we guarantee closedloop stability in the case of output feedback.},

Conventionally, the performance of visual-inertial SLAM is evaluated with open-loop analysis, with a focus on the drift level of SLAM systems. In this paper, we raise the question on the importance of visual estimation latency in closed-loop navigation tasks, such as accurate trajectory tracking. To understand the impact of both drift and latency on visualinertial SLAM systems, a closed-loop benchmarking simulation is conducted, where a robot is commanded to follow a desired trajectory using the feedback from visual-inertial estimation. By extensively evaluating the trajectory tracking performance of representative state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, we reveal the importance of latency reduction in visual estimation module of these systems. The findings suggest directions of future improvements for visual-inertial SLAM.},

	abstract = {Abstract---We present an efficient optimization framework that solves trajectory optimization problems by decoupling state variables from timing variables, thereby decomposing a challenging nonlinear programming (NLP) problem into two easier subproblems. With timing fixed, the state variables can be optimized efficiently using convex optimization, and the timing variables can be optimized in a separate NLP, which forms a bilevel optimization problem. The challenge is to obtain the gradient of the objective function which itself needs an optimization to compute. Whereas finite differences must solve many optimization problems to compute the gradient, our method is based on sensitivity analysis of parametric programming: the dual solution (Lagrange multipliers) of the lower-level optimization is used to compute analytical gradients. Since the dual solution is a by-product of the optimization, the exact gradients can be obtained ``for free''. The framework is demonstrated on generating trajectories in safe corridors for an unmanned aerial vehicle. Experiments demonstrate that bilevel optimization converges significantly more reliably than a standard NLP solver, and analytical gradients outperform finite differences in terms of computation speed and accuracy. With a 25 ms cutoff time, our approach achieves over 8 times better suboptimality than the current state-of-the-art.},

In particular, the mass and aerodynamic properties of the JAVELIN Unmanned Aircraft (UA) are determined using accurate measurements from the 3D scanner and successive CAD processing of the geometric data. In order to qualitatively assess the calculated 6-DoF, the trajectory for the spiral mode excited by the engine torque of this UA is simulated and compared to that of a published 6-DoF of the popular AEROSONDE UA which has very similar geometry. Additionally, to further confirm the validity of the approach, the reverse engineering procedure is applied to a published CAD model of the AEROSONDE UA and the associated 6-DoF parameters are calculated. Using these parameters, a spiral descent trajectory is generated using both the published and calculated parameters. The trajectories match closely, providing a good qualitative verification of the reverse engineering method. In future research, the accurate knowledge of the 6-DoF dynamics will enable the development of an Aircraft Dynamics Model (ADM) virtual sensor to augment the UA navigation system in case of primary navigation sensor outages. Additionally, further refinement of the calculated 6-DoF will involve wind tunnel and flight testing activities.},

@article{JohansenFossen13,
	abstract = {The control algorithm hierarchy of motion control for over-actuated mechanical systems with a redundant set of effectors and actuators commonly includes three levels. First, a high-level motion control algorithm commands a vector of virtual control efforts (i.e. forces and moments) in order to meet the overall motion control objectives. Second, a control allocation algorithm coordinates the different effectors such that they together produce the desired virtual control efforts, if possible. Third, low-level control algorithms may be used to control each individual effector via its actuators. Control allocation offers the advantage of a modular design where the high-level motion control algorithm can be designed without detailed knowledge about the effectors and actuators. Important issues such as input saturation and rate constraints, actuator and effector fault tolerance, and meeting secondary objectives such as power efficiency and tear-and-wear minimization are handled within the control allocation algorithm. The objective of the present paper is to survey control allocation algorithms, motivated by the rapidly growing range of applications that have expanded from the aerospace and maritime industries, where control allocation has its roots, to automotive, mechatronics, and other industries. The survey classifies the different algorithms according to two main classes based on the use of linear or nonlinear models, respectively. The presence of physical constraints (e.g input saturation and rate constraints), operational constraints and secondary objectives makes optimization-based design a powerful approach. The simplest formulations allow explicit solutions to be computed using numerical linear algebra in combination with some logic and engineering solutions, while the more challenging formulations with nonlinear models or complex constraints and objectives call for iterative numerical optimization procedures. Experiences using the different methods in aerospace, maritime, automotive and other application areas are discussed. The paper ends with some perspectives on new applications and theoretical challenges.},

@article{WhiteBeard20,
	abstract = {Abstract---This paper introduces a new algorithm for estimating the relative pose of a moving camera using consecutive frames of a video sequence. State-of-the-art algorithms for calculating the relative pose between two images use matching features to estimate the essential matrix. The essential matrix is then decomposed into the relative rotation and normalized translation between frames. To be robust to noise and feature match outliers, these methods generate a large number of essential matrix hypotheses from randomly selected minimal subsets of feature pairs, and then score these hypotheses on all feature pairs. Alternatively, the algorithm introduced in this paper calculates relative pose hypotheses by directly optimizing the rotation and normalized translation between frames, rather than calculating the essential matrix and then performing the decomposition. The resulting algorithm improves computation time by an order of magnitude. If an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is available, it is used to seed the optimizer, and in addition, we reuse the best hypothesis at each iteration to seed the optimizer thereby reducing the number of relative pose hypotheses that must be generated and scored. These advantages greatly speed up performance and enable the algorithm to run in real-time on low cost embedded hardware. We show application of our algorithm to visual multi-target tracking (MTT) in the presence of parallax and demonstrate its real-time performance on a 640 × 480 video sequence captured on a UAV.

	abstract = {Abstract---Computer vision researchers have proved the
feasibility of camera self-calibration ---the estimation of a
camera's internal parameters from an image sequence without
any known scene structure. Various self-calibration algorithms
have been published. Nevertheless, all of the recent sequential
approaches to 3D structure and motion estimation from image
sequences which have arisen in robotics and aim at real-time
operation (often classed as visual SLAM or visual odometry)
have relied on pre-calibrated cameras and have not attempted
online calibration.
In this paper, we present a sequential filtering algorithm
for simultaneous estimation of 3D scene estimation, camera
trajectory and full camera calibration from a sequence of
fixed but unknown calibration. This calibration comprises the
standard projective parameters of focal length and principal
point along with two radial distortion coefficients. To deal with
the large non-linearities introduced by the unknown calibration
parameters, we use a Sum of Gaussians (SOG) filter rather than
the simpler Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).
To our knowledge, this is the first sequential Bayesian
autocalibration algorithm which achieves complete fixed camera
calibration using as input only a sequence of uncalibrated
monocular images. The approach is validated with experimental
results using natural images, including a demonstration of loop
closing for a sequence with unknown camera calibration.},

	abstract = {Abstract--- Recently, classical pairwise Structure From Motion (SfM) techniques have been combined with non-linear
global optimization (Bundle Adjustment, BA) over a sliding
window to recursively provide camera pose and feature location
estimation from long image sequences. Normally called Visual
Odometry, these algorithms are nowadays able to estimate with
impressive accuracy trajectories of hundreds of meters; either
from an image sequence (usually stereo) as the only input, or
combining visual and propioceptive information from inertial
sensors or wheel odometry.
This paper has a double objective. First, we aim to illustrate
for the first time how similar accuracy and trajectory length
can be achieved by filtering-based visual SLAM methods.
Specifically, a camera-centered Extended Kalman Filter is used
here to process a monocular sequence as the only input, with
6DOF motion estimated. Features are kept live in the filter
while visible as the camera explores forward, and are deleted
from the state once they go out of view.
This permits an increase in the number of tracked features
per frame from tens to around a hundred. While improving the
accuracy of the estimation, it makes computationally infeasible
the exhaustive Branch and Bound search performed by standard JCBB for match outlier rejection. As a second contribution
that overcomes this problem, we present here a RANSAC-like
algorithm that exploits the probabilistic prediction of the filter.
This use of prior information makes it possible to reduce the
size of the minimal data subset to instantiate a hypothesis to the
minimum possible of 1 point, greatly increasing the efficiency
of the outlier rejection stage.
Experimental results from real image sequences covering
trajectories of hundreds of meters are presented and compared
against RTK GPS ground truth. Estimation errors are about
1% of the trajectory for trajectories up to 650 metres.},
	address = {St. Louis},
	annote = {This is an interesting paper.  

The key idea is that when multiple measurements are received, RANSAC is used to select a measurement (thus 1-point) and update the state.  Inliers are then found using this updated state.  After the RANSAC process, all inliers are then used to update the state in a normal Kalman update, measurements are then re-evaluated to see if there are additional inliers, which are then included in a second Kalman update.

Should be applicable to both EKF, but also to Riccati observers.

We then propose a system where this motion planning method is used as a local replanner, that runs at a high rate to continuously recompute safe trajectories as the robot gains information about its environment. We validate our approach by comparing against existing methods and demonstrate the complete system avoiding obstacles on a multirotor UAV platform.},

@conference{WangZhaWang19,
	abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has become more relevant to vehicle dynamics control due to its inherent capacity of treating system constraints. However, online optimization from MPC introduces an extensive computational burden for today's onboard microprocessors. To alleviate MPC computational load, several methods have been proposed. Among them, online successive system linearization and the resulting linear time-varying model predictive controller (LTVMPC) is one of the most popular options. Nevertheless, such online successive linearization commonly approximates the original (nonlinear) system by a linear one, which inevitably introduces extra modeling errors and therefore reduces MPC performance. Actually, if the controlled system possesses the differential flatness property, then it can be exactly linearized and an equivalent linear model will appear. This linear model maintains all the nonlinear features of the original system and can be utilized to design a flatness-based model predictive controller (FMPC). CarSim-Simulink joint simulations demonstrate that the proposed FMPC substantially outperforms a classical LTVMPC in terms of the path-tracking performance for autonomous vehicles.

	abstract = {Abstract--- We propose a novel inertial-aided KLT feature tracking method robust to camera ego-motions. The conventional KLT uses images only and its working condition is inherently limited to small appearance change between images. When big optical flows are induced by a camera-ego motion, an inertial sensor attached to the camera can provide a good prediction to preserve the tracking performance. We use a low-grade MEMS-based gyroscope to refine an initial condition of the nonlinear optimization in the KLT. It increases the possibility for warping parameters to be in the convergence region of the KLT.

For longer tracking with less drift, we use the affine photometric model and it can effectively deal with camera rolling and outdoor illumination change. Extra computational cost caused by this higher-order motion model is alleviated by restraining the Hessian update and GPU acceleration. Experimental results are provided for both indoor and outdoor scenes and GPU implementation issues are discussed.},

control reconfiguration is considered. The objective is to redesign
automatically flight control laws to compensate for actuator failures

reference control are compared. The availability of state measurements
in this application leads to relatively simple algorithms. The respective
advantages and disadvantages of the adaptive algorithms are discussed,
considering their complexity and the assumptions that they require.
An equation-error based algorithm is found to be preferable. Simulations
obtained using a full nonlinear model of a twinengine jet aircraft
are presented. The results demonstrate the ability of the adaptive
algorithms to maintain trim after a failure, to restore tracking
of the pilot commands despite the loss of actuator effectiveness,
and to coordinate the use of the remaining active control surfaces
in order to guarantee the decoupling of the rotational axes. A new
adaptive algorithm with a variable forgetting feature is also used
and is found to yield a useful alternative to covariance resetting
as a solution to covariance wind-up in least-squares algorithms.},

Each of these algorithmic detectors has fundamental limitations in regard to providing consistent measurements. In this paper we present a scalable detection framework that leverages multiple measurement sources. We also present the recursive random sample consensus (R-RANSAC) algorithm in a data fusion architecture that can simultaneously accommodate multiple measurement sources.

We argue that recursive techniques will become more important both for real-time control applications and also interactive vision applications. The aim is to approximate as well as possible the result of the batch bundle adjustment method. In previously published work we described an algorithm which works well if the same features are visible throughout the sequence. Here we show how to deal with new features in a way that avoids deterioration of the results. The main theoretical advance here is showing how to adjust the system information matrix when scene/camera parameters are removed from the reconstruction. We show how this procedure affects the sparseness of the information matrix, and thus how to achieve an efficient recursive solution to the reconstruction problem},

	abstract = {The development and application of increasingly autonomous (IA) systems for civil aviation is proceeding at an accelerating pace, driven by the expectation that such systems will return significant benefits in terms of safety, reliability, efficiency, affordability, and/or previously unattainable mission capabilities. IA systems range from current automatic systems such as autopilots and remotely piloted unmanned aircraft to more highly sophisticated systems that are needed to enable a fully autonomous aircraft that does not require a pilot or human air traffic controllers. These systems, characterized by their ability to perform more complex mission-related tasks with substantially less human intervention for more extended periods of time, sometimes at remote distances, are being envisioned for aircraft and for air traffic management and other ground-based elements of the national airspace system. Civil aviation is on the threshold of potentially revolutionary improvements in aviation capabilities and operations associated with IA systems. These systems, however, face substantial barriers to integration into the national airspace system without degrading its safety or efficiency. Autonomy Research for Civil Aviation identifies key barriers and suggests major elements of a national research agenda to address those barriers and help realize the benefits that IA systems can make to crewed aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems, and ground-based elements of the national airspace system. This report develops a set of integrated and comprehensive technical goals and objectives of importance to the civil aeronautics community and the nation. Autonomy Research for Civil Aviation will be of interest to U.S. research organizations, industry, and academia who have a role in meeting these goals.},

The analysis and results demonstrate that computing both camera/scene motion and 3D structure is essential to computing either with any accuracy. Having computed optimal estimates of structure and motion over a small number of initial images, a recursive version of the algorithm (previously reported) recomputes sub optimal estimates given new image data. The algorithm is designed explicitly for real time implementation, and the complexity is proportional to the number of tracked features. 3D projective, affine and Euclidean models of structure and motion recovery have been implemented, incorporating both point and line features into the computation. The framework can handle any feature type and camera model that may be encapsulated as a projection equation from scene to image},

resentations, namely the direction cosine matrix (DCM), quaternions, Euler angles, and
the angle-axis scheme. Assumptions of constant, linear, and quadratic angular velocities
between samples are also examined. The resulting algorithms are evaluated according to
accuracy, computational load, and noise response. Unit tests using analytic inputs and
integration tests using each approach within the complementary lter framework of the
SLUGS autopilot are performed to evaluate algorithm performance against 
ight test data

matrix exponential with quaternion attitude representation delivers higher accuracy with
low penalty on the computational burden and no signicant dierence for noise resilience.},

@article{Agha-mohammadi2014b,
	abstract = {In this paper we present feedback-based information roadmap (FIRM), a multi-query approach for planning under uncertainty which is a belief-space variant of probabilistic roadmap methods. The crucial feature of FIRM is that the costs associated with the edges are independent of each other, and in this sense it is the first method that generates a graph in belief space that preserves the optimal substructure property. From a practical point of view, FIRM is a robust and reliable planning framework. It is robust since the solution is a feedback and there is no need for expensive replanning. It is reliable because accurate collision probabilities can be computed along the edges. In addition, FIRM is a scalable framework, where the complexity of planning with FIRM is a constant multiplier of the complexity of planning with PRM. In this paper, FIRM is introduced as an abstract framework. As a concrete instantiation of FIRM, we adopt stationary linear quadratic Gaussian (SLQG) controllers as belief stabilizers and introduce the so-called SLQG-FIRM. In SLQG-FIRM we focus on kinematic systems and then extend to dynamical systems by sampling in the equilibrium space. We investigate the performance of SLQG-FIRM in different scenarios.},

The aircraft's closed-loop dynamics are described by means of a hybrid automaton with the hover, transition, level, and recovery operating modes, each one corresponding to a different region of the flight envelope. Linear parameter varying control techniques are employed in hover and level, providing robust local stabilization, and a nonlinear locally input-to-state stable controller provides practical reference tracking to the transition operating mode. These controllers, together with an appropriate choice of reference maneuvers, ensure that a transition from hovered flight to level flight, or vice versa, is achieved. Whenever the aircraft state reaches unexpected values, the recovery controller is triggered in order to drive the aircraft toward stable hovered flight, providing a chance to retry the transition maneuver.

	abstract = {Sampling-based optimal planners, such as RRT*, almost-surely converge asymptotically to the optimal solution, but have provably slow convergence rates in high dimensions. This is because their commitment to finding the global optimum compels them to prioritize exploration of the entire problem domain even as its size grows exponentially. Optimization techniques, such as CHOMP, have fast convergence on these problems but only to local optima. This is because they are exploitative, prioritizing the immediate improvement of a path even though this may not find the global optimum of nonconvex cost functions. In this paper, we present a hybrid technique that integrates the benefits of both methods into a single search. A key insight is that applying local optimization to a subset of edges likely to improve the solution avoids the prohibitive cost of optimizing every edge in a global search. This is made possible by Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), an informed global technique that orders its search by potential solution quality. In our algorithm, Regionally Accelerated BIT* (RABIT*), we extend BIT* by using optimization to exploit local domain information and find alternative connections for edges in collision and accelerate the search. This improves search performance in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes (e.g., narrow passages) while maintaining almost-sure asymptotic convergence to the global optimum. Our experiments on simulated random worlds and real data from an autonomous helicopter show that on certain difficult problems, RABIT* converges 1.8 times faster than BIT*. Qualitatively, in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes, we show that RABIT* is able to efficiently transform paths to avoid obstacles.},

@article{DongFarrellPolycarpou,
	abstract = {Abstract---Implementation of adaptive backstepping controllers

requires analytic calculation of the partial derivatives

of certain stabilizing functions. It is well documented

that, as the order of a nonlinear system increases, analytic

calculation of these derivatives becomes prohibitive. Therefore,

in practice, either alternative control approaches are

used or the derivatives are neglected in the implementation.

Neglecting the derivatives results in the loss of all

guarantees proven by Lyapunov methods for the adaptive

backstepping approach and may result in instability.

This article presents a new implementation approach

for adaptive backstepping control. The main objectives

are to facilitate the derivation and implementation of

the adaptive backstepping approach, with performance

guarantees proven by Lyapunov methods, for applications

that were prohibitively difficult using the standard analytic

implementation approach. The new approach uses filtering

methods to produce certain command signals and their

derivatives which eliminates the requirement of analytic

differentiation. The approach also introduces filters to generated

certain compensating signals necessary to compute

compensated tracking errors suitable for adaptive parameter

estimation. We present a set of Lemmas and Theorems

to analyze the performance both during the initialization

and the operating phases. We show that the initialization

phase is of finite duration that can be controlled by selection

of a design parameter. We also show that all signals within

the system are bounded during this short initialization

phase. During the operating phase, we show that the

command filtered implementation approach has theoretical

properties identical to those of the conventional approach.

The general approach is presented and analyzed for

systems in generalized parameter strict feedback form.

Extensions of the approach are presented to demonstrate

the application of the method to a land vehicle trajectory

following application. Application and effectiveness of the

proposed method is shown by simulation results.},

	abstract = {Abstract---This brief deals with the tracking control design of a
helicopter laboratory experimental setup. In order to be able to
realize highly dynamic flight maneuvers, both input and state constraints
have to be systematically accounted for within the control design
procedure. The mathematical model being considered constitutes a
nonlinear mathematical mechanical system with two control inputs
and three degrees of freedom. The control concept consists of an
inversion-based feedforward controller for trajectory tracking and
a feedback controller for the trajectory error dynamics. The design
of the feedforward controller for a point-topoint flight maneuver
is traced back to the solution of a 2-point boundary value problem
in the Byrnes-Isidori normal form of the mathematical model. By utilizing
special saturation functions, the given constraints in the inputs
and states can be systematically incorporated in the overall design
process. In order to capture model uncertainties and external disturbance,
an optimal state feedback controller is designed on the basis of
the model linearization along the desired trajectories. The proposed
control scheme is implemented in a real-time environment, and the
feasibility and the excellent performance are demonstrated by means
of experimental results.

However, real-time optimization quickly becomes infeasible as the trajectory grows over time; this problem is further emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at high rate, hence leading to fast growth of the number of variables in the optimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes into single relative motion constraints. Our first contribution is a preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group. We formally discuss the generative measurement model as well as the nature of the rotation noise and derive the expression for the maximum a posteriori state estimator. Our theoretical development enables the computation of all necessary Jacobians for the optimization and a-posteriori bias correction in analytic form. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated into a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the application of incremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a structureless model for visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the 3D points, further accelerating the computation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIO pipeline on real and simulated datasets. The results confirm that our modelling effort leads to accurate state estimation in real-time, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

	abstract = {Identification concerning different types of radar targets can be achieved by using various radar signatures, such as one-dimensional (1-D) range profiles, 2-D radar images, and 1-D or 2-D scattering centres on a target. To solve the target identification problem, the authors utilise 1-D scattering centres, which correspond to the highest peaks in the 1-D range profile. The proposed approach obtains scale and translational-invariant features based on the central moments from the distribution of the 1-D scattering centres on the target; these 1-D scattering centres can be extracted from various techniques such as inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), fast root-multiple signal classification (fast root-MUSIC), total least squares-Prony (TLS-Prony), generalised eigenvalues utilising signal subspace eigenvectors (GEESE), and the matrix-pencil (MP) algorithm. The information redundancy contained in these features, as well as their dimensions, are further reduced via the Karhunen--Loeve transform, followed by adequate scaling of the computed central moments. The resulting small dimensional and redundancy-free feature vectors are classified using the Bayes classifier. Finally, this new strategy for radar-target identification is demonstrated with data measured in the compact range facility, and the above five different techniques for 1-D scattering centre extraction are compared and investigated in the context of target identification},

	abstract = {To estimate the relative pose of two cameras from outlier-contaminated feature correspondences, the essential matrix and inlier set is estimated using RANSAC, then this estimate is refined to minimise an error function on the correspondences. This paper evaluates several refinement methods which minimise functions of Sampson's error. All perform well on large sets of correspondences or when inlier rates are high, but many perform poorly or fail when the inlier set found by RANSAC is small; this is shown to be because the inlier sets contain remaining outliers, while missing some inliers. The most accurate solutions are given by minimising the robust Blake-Zisserman function of Sampson's error, although this provides only a minimal improvement in accuracy compared with least squares refinement. The most reliable results are given by nonlinear optimisation constrained to the essential manifold. An efficient parametrisation of the essential manifold as a quaternion and a unit vector is described; applying Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares combined with Levenberg-Marquardt optimisation on this manifold takes typically less than one millisecond.},

In this paper, we modify their mathematical expressions and perform a rigorous analysis on their robustness and complexity for the problem of 3D registration for overlapping point cloud views. More concretely, we present several optimizations that reduce their computation times drastically by either caching previously computed values or by revising their theoretical formulations. The latter results in a new type of local features, called Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH), which retain most of the discriminative power of the PFH. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for the online computation of FPFH features for realtime applications. To validate our results we demonstrate their efficiency for 3D registration and propose a new sample consensus based method for bringing two datasets into the convergence basin of a local non-linear optimizer: SAC-IA (SAmple Consensus Initial Alignment).},

Holonomic and Nonholonomic Constraints, Variational approach, free
flying, kinematic redundancy. Comments: Robotic manipulators will
play a significant role in the maintenance and repair of space stations
and satellites, and other future space missions. Robot path planning
and control for the above applications should be optimum, since any
inefficiency in the planning may considerably risk the success of
the space mission. This paper presents a global optimum path planning
scheme for redundant space robotic manipulators to be used in such
missions. In this formulation, a variational approach is used to
minimize the objective functional. It is assumed that the gravity
is zero in space, and the robotic manipulator is mounted on a completely
free-flying base and the attitude control is off. Linear and angular
monentum conditions for this system lead to a set of mixed holonomic
and nonholonomic constraints. These equations are adjoined to the
objective functional using a Lagrange multiplier technique. The formulation
leads to a system of Differential and Algebraic Equations. A numerical
scheme for forward integration of this system is presented. A planar
redundant space manipulator consisting of three arms and a base is
considered to demonstrate the feasibility of the formulation. The
approach to optimum path planning of redundant space robots is significant
since most robots that have been developed for space applications
so far are redundant. The kinematic redundancy of space robots offers
efficient control and provides the necessary dexterity for extra-vehicular
activity that exheeds human capacity. },

we introduce a new approach called expansion segmentation, which
simultaneously detects ``collision danger regions'' of significant
positive divergence in inertial aided video, and estimates maximum
likelihood time to collision (TTC) in a correspondenceless framework
within the danger regions. This approach was motivated from a literature
review which showed that existing approaches make strong assumptions
about scene structure or camera motion, or pose collision detection
without determining obstacle boundaries, both of which limit the
operational envelope of a deployable system. Expansion segmentation
is based on a new formulation of 6- DOF inertial aided TTC estimation,
and a new derivation of a first order TTC uncertainty model due to
subpixel quantization error and epipolar geometry uncertainty. Proof
of concept results are shown in a custom designed urban flight simulator

	abstract = {This paper reports on a generic factor-based method for node removal in factor-graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which we call generic linear constraints (GLCs). The need for a generic node removal tool is motivated by long-term SLAM applications, whereby nodes are removed in order to control the computational cost of graph optimization. GLC is able to produce a new set of linearized factors over the elimination clique that can represent either the true marginalization (i.e., dense GLC) or a sparse approximation of the true marginalization using a Chow-Liu tree (i.e., sparse GLC). The proposed algorithm improves upon commonly used methods in two key ways: First, it is not limited to graphs with strictly full-state relative-pose factors and works equally well with other low-rank factors, such as those produced by monocular vision. Second, the new factors are produced in such a way that accounts for measurement correlation, which is a problem encountered in other methods that rely strictly upon pairwise measurement composition. We evaluate the proposed method over multiple real-world SLAM graphs and show that it outperforms other recently proposed methods in terms of Kullback--Leibler divergence. Additionally, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed GLC method provides a principled and flexible tool to control the computational complexity of long-term graph SLAM, with results shown for {\$}34.9, rm h{\$} of real-world indoor--outdoor data covering {\$}147.4hbox km{\$} collected over {\$}27{\$} mapping sessions spanning a period of {\$}15{\$} months.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, MIT Press Journals. All rights reserved. Recent results in monocular visual-inertial navigation (VIN) have shown that optimization-based approaches outperform filtering methods in terms of accuracy due to their capability to relinearize past states. However, the improvement comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes. The preintegration allows us to accurately summarize hundreds of inertial measurements into a single relative motion constraint. Our first contribution is a preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group and carefully deals with uncertainty propagation. The measurements are integrated in a local frame, which eliminates the need to repeat the integration when the linearization point changes while leaving the opportunity for belated bias corrections. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated in a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the use of a structureless model for visual measurements, further accelerating the computation. The third contribution is an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIN pipeline: experimental results confirm that our system is very fast and demonstrates superior accuracy with respect to competitive state-of-the-art filtering and optimization algorithms, including off-the-shelf systems such as Google Tango [1].},

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject those that are unstable. Efficient retrieval is achieved by employing methods from statistical text retrieval, including inverted file systems, and text and document frequency weightings. This requires a visual analogy of a word which is provided here by vector quantizing the region descriptors. The final ranking also depends on the spatial layout of the regions. The result is that retrieval is immediate, returning a ranked list of shots in the manner of Google. We report results for object retrieval on the full length feature films 'Groundhog Day', 'Casablanca' and 'Run Lola Run', including searches from within the movie and specified by external images downloaded from the Internet. We investigate retrieval performance with respect to different quantizations of region descriptors and compare the performance of several ranking measures.

The camera pose estimation problem is traditionally solved via algorithms that are based on the essential matrix or the Euclidean homography. With six or more feature points in general positions in the space, essential matrix based algorithms can recover a unique solution. However, such algorithms fail when points are on critical surfaces (e.g., coplanar points) and homography should be used instead. By formulating the problem in quaternions and decoupling the rotation and translation estimation, our proposed algorithm works for all point configurations. Using both simulated and real world images, we compare the estimation accuracy of our algorithm with some of the most commonly used algorithms. Our method is shown to be more robust to noise and outliers. For the benefit of community, we have made the implementation of our algorithm available online and free.},

We examine the observability of other relative states needed to do the handoff problem. In particular, we consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the relative position between the aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a radar or a lidar sensor. We assume that the two aircrafts do not exchange their airspeed and turn rate information. Under mild assumptions, we show that the relative heading between the two aircrafts is observable. In the second scenario, we assume that only the bearing angle between the two aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a vision sensor.

an unmanned

aerial vehicle (UAV) by means of an on-board camera. Only natural
landmarks

provided by a feature tracking algorithm will be considered, without
the help of

visual beacons or landmarks with known positions. First, it is described
a monocular

visual odometer which could be used as a backup system when the accuracy
of GPS

is reduced to critical levels. Homography-based techniques are used
to compute

the UAV relative translation and rotation by means of the images gathered
by an

onboard camera. The analysis of the problem takes into account the
stochastic nature

of the estimation and practical implementation issues. The visual
odometer is then

integrated into a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) scheme
in order

to reduce the impact of cumulative errors in odometry-based position
estimation},

@article{Veettil2016,
	abstract = {Recursive estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems is an important problem that arises in several engineering applications. Consistent and accurate propagation of uncertainties is important to ensuring good estimation performance. It is well known that the posterior state estimates in nonlinear problems may assume non-Gaussian multimodal densities. In the past, Gaussian mixture filters and particle filters were introduced to handle non-Gaussianity and nonlinearity. However, these methods have seen only limited success as most mixture filters attempt to fix the number of mixture modes during estimation process, and the particle filters suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a particle based Gaussian mixture filtering approach for the general nonlinear estimation problem that is free of the particle depletion problem inherent to most particle filters. We employ an ensemble of randomly sampled states for the propagation of state probability density. A Gaussian mixture model of the propagated uncertainty is then recovered by clustering the ensemble. The posterior density is obtained subsequently through a Kalman measurement update of the mixture modes. We prove the weak convergence of the PGM density to the true filter density assuming exponential forgetting of initial conditions by the true filter. The estimation performance of the proposed filtering approach is demonstrated through several test cases.},

a nonlinear estimation scheme that allows the development

of accurate and robust system estimates in the presence of nonlinearities,

noise, and faults, in real time. Traditional state estimation

for linear systems has a rich, elegant theory, namely, the stochastic

Kalman filter. Extension of Kalman filtering theory, especially

guarantees, to nonlinear systems is nontrivial. The extended Kalman

filter (EKF) (see Ref. 1) is an approximate extension of Kalman

filtering techniques to nonlinear systems by linearizing the state

dynamics at each time step. The EKF does not require linearity,

stability, or time invariance of the system; it does require that
the

state dynamics are sufficiently differentiable, that is, the Jacobian

exists. Although the EKF is quite flexible and well used in applications

such as radar tracking and global positioning systems,

disadvantages include sensitivities to required a priori information

(initial state and noise environment), which can lead to bias and
even

divergence.2},

In terms of evolution, goats could be separated by their dispersion area in three large groups: the European, the Asian, and the African. Global goat populations, mainly in Africa and in Asia, have increased for centuries but very strongly in the past decades, well above the world population growth. They are also used for forest grazing, an integrated and alter- native production system, very useful to control weed growth reducing ire risk. Despite some exceptions, no large‐scale efort to professionalize this industry has been made so far. There are consumers for goat dairy products and there is enough global production, but misses a professional network between both. Regarding goat meat, the world leader- ship also stays in Africa and Asia, namely in China, and there is a new phenomenon, the spreading of goat meat tradition through Europe due to migrants from Africa and other places with strong goat meat consumption.},

	abstract = {This article describes the graphics facilities of the R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. There is a brief introduction to basic plotting functions in R, followed by a description of the organisation of R graphics into coherent and consistent sets of graphics functions, plus an indication of what sorts of plots each set of functions can produce. There is also a brief discussion of the limitations of R graphics. One of the features that draws many users to R1 is the graphics sub-system. The main features that distinguish R from the many other software systems that can be used to produce plots are that R provides facilities for creating a very wide range of statistical plots, R allows for very fine control over the appearance of plots, and R produces plots that are suitable for professional publication. This article provides an overview of the basic features of R graphics, along with some simple examples of how to produce plots using R. The general structure and organisation of R graphics is also described to give the reader some indication of how to explore R graphics system further. While some graphical user interfaces exist for R, and some of these provide menu items for producing plots, the only way to make use of the full power of the R graphics system is to write R code, so this article will only address the R code that can be used to produce plots},

The proposed planner follows a two--step, receding horizon, belief space--based approach. At first, in an online computed tree the algorithm finds the branch that optimizes the amount of space expected to be explored. The first viewpoint configuration of this branch is selected, but the path towards it is decided through a second planning step. Within that, a new tree is sampled, admissible branches arriving at the reference viewpoint are found and the robot belief about its state and the tracked landmarks of the environment is propagated. The branch that minimizes the expected localization and mapping uncertainty is selected, the corresponding path is executed by the robot and the whole process is iteratively repeated. The proposed planner is capable of running online onboard a small aerial robot and its performance is evaluated using experimental studies in a challenging environment.},

different measures of the 'extent' or 'size' of the solution of the
algebraic matrix equations arising in control theory, such as the
Riccati equation and the Lyapunov equation. This paper collects the

	abstract = { Johnny Evers vision of how biology should help in MAV airframe design,
and navigation, guidance, and control.

The ease with which flying insects, birds and bats negotiate confined,
obstacle-cluttered airspace has long inspired us with visions of
human-designed aerial machines with similar performance. Flying animals
exhibit capabilities for aerial acrobatics, insensitivity to wind
gusts, avoiding collision with or intercepting fixed and moving objects,
landing and take off from small perches, and numerous other feats
of flight agility that are beyond those of human-engineered vehicles.
Although we are naturally tempted to look to biological organisms
for inspiration or as design templates, the performance of the resulting
bio-inspired or biomimetic engineered devices rarely approaches that
of the living organisms. Among several possible reasons for this,
two important issues motivate and provide a focus for this paper:
it is nearly impossible to correlate biological processes with engineering
design principles; biological systems possess sensing-computationactuation
response architectures and processes that appear to differ from those
of engineered systems in fundamental ways, those differences are
poorly understood and their importance little appreciated. These
issues provide rich opportunities for research to produce genuine
advancements in our understanding of biological and artificial autonomy.
The research will necessarily involve biologists, engineers, and
mathematicians. As with any research endeavor involving multiple
mature disciplines, long term research collaborations are necessary
for establishing the foundation of fundamentally new science. Unfortunately,
without an objective understanding of these two issues and their
implications for guiding autonomous air vehicle research and development,
the real promise for biology-inspired or biomimetic concepts to achieve
breakthroughs in vehicle capabilities may remain an elusive dream.

	abstract = {While collision avoidance and flight stability are generally a micro air vehicle's (MAVs) highest priority, many map-based path planning algorithms focus on path optimality, often assuming a static, known environment. For many MAV applications a robust navigation solution requires responding quickly to obstacles in dynamic, tight environments with non- negligible disturbances. This article first outlines the Reac- tive Obstacle Avoidance Plugin framework as a method for leveraging map-based algorithms while providing low-latency, high-bandwidth response to obstacles. Further, we propose and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Cushioned Extended- Periphery Avoidance (CEPA) algorithm. By representing recent laser scans in the current body-fixed polar coordinate frame, a 360○ lower-bound understanding of the environment is available. With this extended field of view, motion assump- tions common in other reactive planners can be relaxed and emergency control effort can be applied in any direction. CEPA is validated in simulation and on hardware in a GPS-denied environment using strictly onboard computation and sensing.},

	abstract = {Abstract---This paper considers the problem of obtaining good

attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low

cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are

characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases.

We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer

kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO(3)

driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements.

Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are

derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error.

The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct

complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal

group a related observer, termed the passive complementary

filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from

the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct

and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online.
The

passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms

of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction

of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the

explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and

gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware;

and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the

gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated

with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed

and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

@article{CiveraDavisonMontiel08,
	abstract = {Abstract?We present a new parametrization for point features

within monocular simultaneous localization and mapping

(SLAM) that permits efficient and accurate representation of uncertainty

during undelayed initialization and beyond, all within

the standard extended Kalman filter (EKF). The key concept

is direct parametrization of the inverse depth of features relative

to the camera locations from which they were first viewed,

which produces measurement equations with a high degree of

linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope with features

over a huge range of depths, even those that are so far fromthe camera

that they present little parallax during motion?maintaining

sufficient representative uncertainty that these points retain the
opportunity

to ?come in? smoothly from infinity if the camera makes

larger movements. Feature initialization is undelayed in the sense

that even distant features are immediately used to improve camera

motion estimates, acting initially as bearing references but not

permanently labeled as such. The inverse depth parametrization

remains well behaved for features at all stages of SLAM processing,

but has the drawback in computational terms that each point is

represented by a 6-D state vector as opposed to the standard three

of a Euclidean XYZ representation. We show that once the depth

estimate of a feature is sufficiently accurate, its representation
can

safely be converted to the Euclidean XYZ form, and propose a

linearity index that allows automatic detection and conversion to

maintain maximum efficiency?only low parallax features need be

maintained in inverse depth form for long periods. We present a

real-time implementation at 30 Hz, where the parametrization is

validated in a fully automatic 3-D SLAM system featuring a handheld

single camera with no additional sensing. Experiments show

robust operation in challenging indoor and outdoor environments

with a very large ranges of scene depth, varied motion, and also

real time 360? loop closing.},

The leading contemporary 5-point solver (Nister, 2004) is slow because of the expensive linear algebra decompositions and polynomial solve which are required. To avoid these costs we propose to use Levenberg-Marquardt optimisation on a manifold to find a subset of the compatible essential matrices. The proposed algorithm finds essential matrices at a higher rate than closed-form approaches, and reduces the time needed to find relative poses using RANSAC by 25{\%}. The second contribution of this paper is to apply the optimisations used in 5-point solvers to the classic 7-point algorithm. RANSAC using the optimised 7-point algorithm is considerably faster than 5-point RANSAC (unless planar point configurations are common), despite the increased number of iterations necessary. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

equation related to the infinite horizon problem of deterministic
control theory. Approximate solutions are constructed by means of
a discretization in time as well as in the state variable and we
prove that their rate of convergence to the viscosity solution is
of order 1, provided a semiconcavity assumption is satisfied. A computational
algorithm, originally due to R. Gonzales and E. Rofman, is adapted

This is because their commitment to finding the global optimum compels them to prioritize exploration of the entire problem domain even as its size grows exponentially. Optimization techniques, such as CHOMP, have fast convergence on these problems but only to local optima. This is because they are exploitative, prioritizing the immediate improvement of a path even though this may not find the global optimum of nonconvex cost functions.},

use of the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) as it applies to spacecraft
attitude estimation. The application of the UKF is clearly explained.
Quaternions are used to represent the attitude of the spacecraft.
The paper explains that straightforward application of the UKF results
in measurement update equations that violate the unit norm constraint
of the unit quaternion. As an alternative the attitude error is converted
to an attitude representation that looks like a modified Rodrigues
parameterization. The measurement update is performed with these
parameters and then converted back into quaternion representation
for the time update law. Simulation results indicate that for large
initial attitude error, the UKF performs significantly better than
the EKF. },

Recently, the novel random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm shows a good tracking performance in dense clutter environment.

In this paper, a density-based recursive random sample consensus (DBR-RANSAC) algorithm is proposed, which utilizes the density property of measurements within several steps to direct sampling. In the DBR-RANSAC, the randomness of sampling can be avoided and the computation complexity can be reduced particularly in dense clutter.

We first present a globally exponentially stable observer for attitude and gyro bias, based on gyro measurements and two or more pairs of vector measurements. We avoid the well-known topological obstructions to global stability by not confining the attitude estimate to SO(3), but rather estimating a full rotation matrix with nine degrees of freedom. We also show how the attitude can be estimated under a relaxed persistency-of-excitation condition, with a single vector measurement as a special case. Next, we use the attitude observer to construct a globally exponentially stable observer for gnss/ins integration, based on accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer measurements, as well as gnss measurements of position and (optionally) velocity. We verify the stability properties of the design using experimental data from a light fixed-wing aircraft.},

This paper demonstrates another example of being able to design a

a closed form solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs inequality.
The control will, of course, be suboptimal, with no real indication
of optimality. Simulation results presented in this paper are very
nice and show that nonlinear H-infinity control has merit. The synthesized
control law also turns out to be linear. It would be interesting
to use our software to see if better results can be obtained using
some nonlinear terms and performing an optimization on {\$}\backslashgamma{\backslash{\$}}.
In addition, it would be fairly simple to get experimental results.

@article{Ueng2008a,
	abstract = {In this article, efficient computational models for ship motions are presented. These models are used to simulate ship movements in real time. Compared with traditional approaches, our method possesses the ability to cope with different ship shapes, engines, and sea conditions without the loss of efficiency. Based on our models, we create a ship motion simulation system for both entertainment and educational applications. Our system assists users to learn the motions of a ship encountering waves, currents, and winds. Users can adjust engine powers, rudders, and other ship facilities via a graphical user interface to create their own ship models. They can also change the environment by altering wave frequencies, wave amplitudes, wave directions, currents, and winds. Therefore, numerous combinations of ships and the environment are generated and the learning becomes more amusing. In our system, a ship is treated as a rigid body floating on the sea surface. Its motions compose of 6 degrees of freedom: pitch, heave, roll, surge, sway, and yaw. These motions are divided into two categories. The first three movements are induced by sea waves, and the last three ones are caused by propellers, rudders, currents, and winds. Based on Newton's laws and other basic physics motion models, we deduce algorithms to compute the magnitudes of the motions. Our methods can be carried out in real time and possess high fidelity. According to ship theory, the net effects of external forces on the ship hull depend on the ship shape. Therefore, the behaviors of the ship are influenced by its shape. To enhance our physics models, we classify ships into three basic types. They are flat ships, thin ships, and slender ships. Each type of ship is associated with some predefined parameters to specify their characteristics. Users can tune ship behaviors by varying the parameters even though they have only a little knowledge of ship theory. Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008.},

Existing robust SLAM methods assume a good initialization or an  odometry back-bone  to classify inlier and outlier loop closures. In the multi-robot case, these assumptions do not always hold. This paper presents an algorithm called Pairwise Consistency Max-imization (PCM) that estimates the largest pairwise internally consistent set of measurements. Finding the largest pairwise internally consistent set can be transformed into an instance of the maximum clique problem from graph theory, and by leveraging the associated literature it can be solved in real-time. This paper evaluates how well PCM approximates the combinatorial gold standard using simulated data. It also evaluates the performance of PCM on synthetic and real-world data sets in comparison with DCS, SCGP, and RANSAC, and shows that PCM significantly outperforms these methods.},

For applications in which this filter is appropriate, it is likely to be tractable for only a small number of targets. In earlier papers we derived closed-form equations for an approximation of this filter based on propagation of a first-order multitarget moment called the probability hypothesis density (PHD). In a recent paper, Erdinc, Willett, and Bar-Shalom argued for the need for a PHD-type filter which remains first-order in the states of individual targets, but which is higher-order in target number. In this paper we show that this is indeed possible. We derive a closed-form cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filter, which propagates not only the PHD but also the entire probability distribution on target number.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus, otherwise called human herpes virus type 5, is a transfusion transmissible pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality among various groups of individuals with damaged or impaired host immunity. Although it has a worldwide distribution, the infection is thought to be more widespread in developing countries where certain demographic factors and living conditions are thought to be responsible for the observed increased prevalence of this infection. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of living conditions, using certain selected demographic parameters, on CMV seropositivity, among blood donors in Jos. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 200 prospective blood donors who presented for bleeding were recruited consecutively into the study. Questionnaire was used to obtain the personal, educational, social and demographic data of donors. Screening for CMV antibodies was performed on each serum sample using ELISA kit (DIALAB, Austria) (www.dialab.at). RESULTS: The relationship between the extent of crowding and CMV status of donors was statistically significant, p{\textless}0.05. Other studied donor demographic parameters (source of drinking water, place of abode and type of toilet facility) did not statistically influence donor CMV status, p{\textgreater}0.05. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that overcrowding was the most significant factor that statistically influenced donor CMV status in Jos, Nigeria. There is, therefore, an urgent need for concerted effort to handle the problem of overcrowding in developing countries and Nigeria in particular.},

This paper presents the design of a complete control system for the autonomous landing of unmanned flybarless helicopters on known stationary visual landmarks. A state estimator based on the complementary filters notion, estimates the position, translational velocity and attitude vectors of the vehicle by fusing data acquired from the on--board camera and an Inertial Measurement Unit. A vision-aided nonlinear model predictive controller is designed for the landing motion of the helicopter, assuming that the on--board camera is rigidly (i.e., no additional Degrees of Freedom (DOF)) attached on the vehicle. Although the under--actuated character of the helicopter dynamics introduces counter--goals for minimizing the error between the vehicle and the landmark, the proposed control scheme guarantees, via hard nonlinear constraints, that the landmark will always be kept inside the camera field of view during the landing procedure. In order to simplify the derived algorithm without violating the robustness of the proposed controller, we reformulate the translational helicopter dynamics in order to reduce the number of the unknown model parameters to a minimum. Moreover, a parameter/disturbance observer is designed for estimating simultaneously the vehicle's unknown dynamic parameters as well as the induced disturbances. The efficacy of the proposed landing scheme is evaluated via a set of experimental and simulation results, using a small--scale flybarless helicopter.},

The aim of this document is to propose a newmethod for solving the homography decomposition problem. This newmethod provides analytical expressions for the solutions of the problem, instead of the traditional numerical procedures. As a result, expressions of the translation vector, rotation matrix and object-plane normal are explicitly expressed as a function of the entries of the homography matrix. The main advantage of this method is that it will provide a deeper understanding on the homography decomposition problem. For instance, it allows to obtain the relations among the possible solutions of the problem. Thus, new vision-based robot control laws can be designed. For example the control schemes proposed in this report combine the two final solutions of the problem (only one of them being the true one) assuming that there is no a priori knowledge for discerning among them.},

@conference{ChoudhuryGammellBarfoot16,
	abstract = {Abstract--- Sampling-based optimal planners, such as RRT*, almost-surely converge asymptotically to the optimal solution, but have provably slow convergence rates in high dimensions. This is because their commitment to finding the global optimum compels them to prioritize exploration of the entire problem domain even as its size grows exponentially. Optimization techniques, such as CHOMP, have fast convergence on these problems but only to local optima. This is because they are exploitative, prioritizing the immediate improvement of a path even though this may not find the global optimum of nonconvex cost functions.

In this paper, we present a hybrid technique that integrates the benefits of both methods into a single search. A key insight is that applying local optimization to a subset of edges likely to improve the solution avoids the prohibitive cost of optimizing every edge in a global search. This is made possible by Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), an informed global technique that orders its search by potential solution quality. In our algorithm, Regionally Accelerated BIT* (RABIT*), we extend BIT* by using optimization to exploit local domain information and find alternative connections for edges in collision and accelerate the search. This improves search performance in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes (e.g., narrow passages) while maintaining almost-sure asymptotic convergence to the global optimum.

Our experiments on simulated random worlds and real data from an autonomous helicopter show that on certain difficult problems, RABIT* converges 1.8 times faster than BIT*. Qualitatively, in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes, we show that RABIT* is able to efficiently transform paths to avoid obstacles.},

We pose the problem of finding the best vertex positional configuration in the presence of an additional proximity constraint, in the sense that, the second smallest eigenvalue of the corresponding graph Laplacian is maximized. In many recent applications of algebraic graph theory in systems and control, the second smallest eigenvalue of Laplacian has emerged as a critical parameter that influences the stability and robustness properties of dynamic systems that operate over an information network. Our motivation in the present work is to assign this Laplacian eigenvalue when relative positions of various elements dictate the interconnection of the underlying weighted graph.

Despite the recent flight control regulations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are still gaining popularity in civilian and military applications, as much as for personal use. Such emerging interest is pushing the development of effective collision avoidance systems. Such systems play a critical role UAVs operations especially in a crowded airspace setting. Because of cost and weight limitations associated with UAVs payload, camera based technologies are the de-facto choice for collision avoidance navigation systems. This requires multitarget detection and tracking algorithms from a video, which can be run on board efficiently. While there has been a great deal of research on object detection and tracking from a stationary camera, few have attempted to detect and track small UAVs from a moving camera. In this paper, we present a new approach to detect and track UAVs from a single camera mounted on a different UAV. Initially, we estimate background motions via a perspective transformation model and then identify distinctive points in the background subtracted image. We find spatio-temporal traits of each moving object through optical flow matching and then classify those candidate targets based on their motion patterns compared with the background. The performance is boosted through Kalman filter tracking. This results in temporal consistency among the candidate detections. The algorithm was validated on video datasets taken from a UAV. Results show that our algorithm can effectively detect and track small UAVs with limited computing resources.},

	abstract = {The displacement of a calibrated camera between two images of a planar object can be estimated by decomposing a homography matrix. The aim of this document is to propose a newmethod for solving the homography decomposition problem. This newmethod provides analytical expressions for the solutions of the problem, instead of the traditional numerical procedures. As a result, expressions of the translation vector, rotation matrix and object-plane normal are explicitly expressed as a function of the entries of the homography matrix. The main advantage of this method is that it will provide a deeper understanding on the homography decomposition problem. For instance, it allows to obtain the relations among the possible solutions of the problem. Thus, new vision-based robot control laws can be designed. For example the control schemes proposed in this report combine the two final solutions of the problem (only one of them being the true one) assuming that there is no a priori knowledge for discerning among them.},

Autonomous unmanned aerial systems can be used in a large number of applications such as inspection, monitoring, data collection, surveillance, etc. At present, vehicles operate with limited autonomy and a minimum of intelligence. There is a growing interest for cooperative and coordinated multi-vehicle systems, real-time re-planning, robust autonomous navigation systems and robust autonomous control of vehicles. Unmanned vehicles with high levels of autonomy may be used for safe and efficient collection of environmental data, for assimilation of climate and environmental models and to complement global satellite systems.

Specifically, we use image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to track the platform in two-dimensional image space and generate a velocity reference command used as the input to an adaptive sliding mode controller. Compared with other vision-based control algorithms that reconstruct a full three-dimensional representation of the target, which requires precise depth estimation, IBVS is computationally cheaper since it is less sensitive to the depth estimation allowing for a faster method to obtain this estimate. To enhance velocity tracking of the sliding mode controller, an adaptive rule is described to account for the ground effect experienced during the maneuver. Finally, the IBVS algorithm integrated with the adaptive sliding mode controller for tracking and landing is validated in an experimental setup using a quadrotor.},

@article{HamelSamson18,
	abstract = {This paper revisits the problem of estimating the pose (position and orientation) of a body in 3-D space with respect to (w.r.t.) an inertial frame by using 1) the knowledge of source points positions in the inertial frame, 2) the measurements of the body angular velocity expressed in the body's frame, 3) the measurements of the body translational velocity, either in the body frame or in the inertial frame, and 4) source points bearing measurements performed in the body frame. An important difference with the much studied static Perspective-n-Point problem addressed with iterative algorithms is that body motion is not only allowed but also used as a source of information that improves the estimation possibilities. With respect to the probabilistic framework commonly used in other studies that develop extended Kalman filter solutions, the deterministic approach here adopted is better suited to point out the observability conditions, that involve the number and disposition of the source points in combination with bodymotion characteristics, under which the proposed observers ensure robust estimation of the body pose. These observers are here named Riccati observers because of the instrumental role played by the continuous Riccati equation in the design of the observers and in the Lyapunov stability and convergence analysis that we develop independently of the well-known complementary (either deterministic or probabilistic) optimality properties associated with Kalman filtering. The set of these observers also encompasses extended Kalman filter solutions. Another contribution of this study is to show the importance of using body motion to improve the observers performance and, when this is possible, of measuring the body translational velocity in the inertial frame rather than in the body frame to allow for the body pose estimation from a single source point taken as the origin of the inertial frame. This latter possibility finds a natural extension in the Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) problem in Robotics.},

	abstract = {Abstract--The Hough transform is a method for detecting curves by exploiting the duality between points on a curve and parameters of that curve. The initial work showed how to detect both analytic curves(1'2) and non-analytic curves,(3)but these methods were restricted to binary edge images.This work was generalizedto the detection of some analytic curves in grey levelimages,specificallylines,14)circles15)and parabolas/6) The line detection case is the best known of these and has been ingeniouslyexploited in severalapplications/7'89) We show how the boundaries of an arbitrary non-analytic shape can be used to construct a mapping betweenimage space and Hough transform space. Such a mapping can be exploited to detect instances of that particular shape in an image. Furthermore, variations in the shape such as rotations, scale changes or figure-ground reversals correspond to straightforward transformations of this mapping. However, the most remarkable property is that such mappings can be composed to build mappings for complex shapes from the mappings of simpler component shapes. This makes the generalized Hough transform a kind of universal transform which can be used to find arbitrarily complex shapes.},

(VIN) have shown that optimization-based approaches
outperform filtering methods in terms of accuracy due to their
capability to relinearize past states. However, the improvement
comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. In this
paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements
between selected keyframes. The preintegration allows us
to accurately summarize hundreds of inertial measurements into
a single relative motion constraint. Our first contribution is a
preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure
of the rotation group and carefully deals with uncertainty
propagation. The measurements are integrated in a local frame,
which eliminates the need to repeat the integration when the
linearization point changes while leaving the opportunity for
belated bias corrections. The second contribution is to show that
the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated in a
visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor
graphs. This enables the use of a structureless model for visual
measurements, further accelerating the computation. The third
contribution is an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIN

	abstract = {Abstract---Current approaches for visual--inertial odometry
(VIO) are able to attain highly accurate state estimation via nonlinear
optimization. However, real-time optimization quickly becomes
infeasible as the trajectory grows over time; this problem is further
emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at high
rate, hence, leading to the fast growth of the number of variables
in the optimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating
inertial measurements between selected keyframes into
single relative motion constraints. Our first contribution is a preintegration
theory that properly addresses the manifold structure
of the rotation group. We formally discuss the generative measurement
model as well as the nature of the rotation noise and
derive the expression for the maximum a posteriori state estimator.
Our theoretical development enables the computation of all
necessary Jacobians for the optimization and a posteriori bias correction
in analytic form. The second contribution is to show that
the preintegrated inertial measurement unit model can be seamlessly
integrated into a visual--inertial pipeline under the unifying
framework of factor graphs. This enables the application of
incremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a structureless
model for visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the
3-D points, further accelerating the computation. We perform an
extensive evaluation of our monocular VIO pipeline on real and
simulated datasets. The results confirm that our modeling effort
leads to an accurate state estimation in real time, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Abstract---We address the complete state estimation problem
of unmanned aerial vehicles, even under high-dynamic
3-D aerobatic maneuvers, while using low-cost sensors with
bias variations and higher levels of noise. In such conditions,
the control demand, for a robust real-time data fusion filter
with minimal lag and noise, is addressed with the efficiency
of a complementary filter scheme. First, the attitude is directly
estimated in Special Orthogonal Group (SO(3)) by complementing
the noisy accelerometer/magnetometer vector basis with a
gyro propagated vector basis. Data fusion follows a least square
minimization in SO(3) (Wahba's problem) solved in an analytic
nonrecursive manner. Stability of the proposed filter is shown and
performance metrics are extracted, whereas the computational
complexity has been minimized with an appropriate reference
frame and a custom singular value decomposition algorithm.
An adaptation scheme is proposed to allow unhindered operation
of the filter to erroneous inputs introduced by the high dynamics
of a 3-D flight. Finally, the velocity/position estimation is mainly
constructed by complementary filters combining multiple sensors.
In addition to the low complexity and the filtering of the noise, the
proposed observer is aided through a developed vision algorithm,
enabling the use of the filter in Global-Positioning-System-denied
environments. Extensive experimental results and comparative
studies with state-of-the-art filters, either in the laboratory or
in the field using high-performance autonomous helicopters,
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in demanding
conditions.},

Thus, it is important to have reliable methods to pass from one representation to the other. While passing from a quaternion to the corresponding rotation matrix is given by Euler-Rodrigues formula, the other way round can be performed in many different ways. Although all of them are algebraically equivalent, their numerical behavior can be quite different. In 1978, Shepperd proposed a method for computing the quaternion corresponding to a rotation matrix which is considered the most reliable method to date. Shepperd's method, thanks to a voting scheme between four possible solutions, always works far from formulation singularities. In this paper, we propose a new method which outperforms Shepperd's method without increasing the computational cost.},

handoff between two fixed wing aircrafts that do not have access

the relative pose between the vehicles. We assume that onboard

relative states needed to do the handoff problem. In particular,
we consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario,
we assume that the relative position between the aircrafts is
measured, as would be the case for a radar or a lidar sensor.
We assume that the two aircrafts do not exchange their airspeed
and turn rate information. Under mild assumptions, we show
that the relative heading between the two aircrafts is observable.
In the second scenario, we assume that only the bearing angle
between the two aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for
a vision sensor. We prove state observability for maneuvers that
are relevant to target tracking and handoff. We also present an
estimation algorithm that uses a bank of extended Kalman filters
to estimate the relative states. Simulation results with full vehicle

	abstract = {Abstract---When tracking maneuvering targets with conventional
algorithms, the process noise standard deviation used in
the nearly constant velocity Kalman filter is selected vaguely
in relation to the maximum acceleration of the target. The
deterministic tracking index has been introduced and used to
develop a relationship between the maximum acceleration and
the process noise variance that minimizes the maximum mean
squared error (MMSE) in position. A lower bound on the process
noise variance has also been expressed in terms of the maximum
acceleration and deterministic tracking index. Both of these
results were developed for sustained maneuvers in that all of
the transient effects of the maneuver have diminished. In this
paper, the results for sustained maneuvers are extended to brief
maneuvers. For each case, the process noise variance is expressed
in terms of the maximum acceleration, duration of the maneuver
in number of measurements, and deterministic tracking index
for both the discrete white noise acceleration and continuous
white noise acceleration models for nearly constant velocity
motion. With the use of Monte Carlo simulations, the method
for choosing process noise variance for tracking maneuvering
targets is demonstrated to be effective for both sustained and
brief maneuvers.},

@article{BiancoKaessEustice14,
	abstract = {This paper reports on a generic factor-based method for node removal in factor-graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which we call generic linear constraints (GLCs). The need for a generic node removal tool is motivated by long-term SLAM applications, whereby nodes are removed in order to control the computational cost of graph optimization. GLC is able to produce a new set of linearized factors over the elimination clique that can represent either the true marginalization (i.e., dense GLC) or a sparse approximation of the true marginalization using a ChowLiu tree (i.e., sparse GLC). The proposed algorithm improves upon commonly used methods in two key ways: First, it is not limited to graphs with strictly full-state relative-pose factors and works equally well with other low-rank factors, such as those produced by monocular vision. Second, the new factors are produced in such a way that accounts for measurement correlation, which is a problem encountered in other methods that rely strictly upon pairwise measurement composition. We evaluate the proposed method over multiple real-world SLAM graphs and show that it outperforms other recently proposed methods in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Additionally, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed GLC method provides a principled and flexible tool to control the computational complexity of long-term graph SLAM, with results shown for 34.9 h of real-world indoor-outdoor data covering 147.4 km collected over 27 mapping sessions spanning a period of 15 months.},

@conference{AnsariZhangBernstein18,
	abstract = {Although novel aircraft designs can be quickly conceived and built, the ability to develop
and test these concepts is impeded by the inability to rapidly prototype autopilots that can
accommodate unconventional airframes with nonstandard sensor/actuator congurations.
For vehicles that are complex or expensive and that are intended for military or civil
certication and production, autopilots are traditionally designed based on a combination
of multi-body modeling, computational 
uid dynamics, and wind tunnel testing. However,
detailed models are not available for experimental 
ight vehicles, and thus manual autopilot
tuning is needed without guarantees of success. To overcome this problem, the present
paper focuses on an adaptive control technique that requires minimal modeling and limited
tuning. In particular, we apply retrospective cost adaptive (RCAC) control to three aircraft
simulation models. The rst aircraft is a quadcopter, and the second is a xed-wing vehicle.
Next, we consider a VTOL vehicle that can 
y in both quadcopter and xed-wing modes.
The RCAC tunings for the VTOL aircraft in quadcopter and xed-wing mode are chosen to
be identical to the tunings of the quadcopter and xed-wing aircraft despite the dierences
in vehicle geometry. The goal is to assess the ability of RCAC to control dierent airframes
with the same tunings, while also assessing the ability to control the VTOL aircraft during
mode transition.},

system for the autonomous landing of unmanned flybarless
helicopters on known stationary visual landmarks. A
state estimator based on the complementary filters notion,
estimates the position, translational velocity and attitude
vectors of the vehicle by fusing data acquired from the on--

nonlinear model predictive controller is designed for
the landing motion of the helicopter, assuming that the

under--actuated character of the helicopter dynamics introduces
counter--goals for minimizing the error between the
vehicle and the landmark, the proposed control scheme
guarantees, via hard nonlinear constraints, that the landmark
will always be kept inside the camera field of view during
the landing procedure. In order to simplify the derived algorithm
without violating the robustness of the proposed controller,
we reformulate the translational helicopter dynamics
in order to reduce the number of the unknown model parameters
to a minimum. Moreover, a parameter/disturbance
observer is designed for estimating simultaneously the vehicle's
unknown dynamic parameters as well as the induced

transportation by amobile robot formation is introduced. The architecture
consists of an object level controller that computes actuation
forces/torques to push an object along a desired path. These
desired forces/torques are provided to a multirobot actuation subsystem
that uses a closed-loop hybrid force/position controller to
generate commands for individual robots within the subsystem.
Accordingly, these robots apply the required net force and torque
to the object while also maintaining relative positions with respect
to themselves and to the object, thereby ensuring stable motion
and efficient torque generation. This novel use of a hybrid controller
for the mobile multirobot cluster prevents large environmental
forces on the object. Furthermore, abstraction of the cluster as
an actuator enhances flexibility, making design of the object controller
independent of the number, location, and maneuverability of
individual robots. The architecture is validated experimentally.},

We describe the development of a small frequency-modulated continuous-wave phased-array radar system that provides a three-dimensional surveillance volume. The radar measurements are processed using the recursive random sample consensus algorithm, producing tracks for the intruders and the ownship. We propose a collision-detection algorithm based on the geometric relationship between encountering aircraft. If a collision threat is detected, a collision-free new path is generated for the ownship using a two-step path-planning algorithm. In the first step, an initial suboptimal path is generated using an A∗ search. In the second step, the path is refined using a variant of the potential fields technique, adapted to the sense-and-avoid scenario. The performance of the complete system is demonstrated with flight-test experiments.

uncertainty which is a belief-space variant of probabilistic roadmap methods. The crucial feature of FIRM is that the
costs associated with the edges are independent of each other, and in this sense it is the first method that generates
a graph in belief space that preserves the optimal substructure property. From a practical point of view, FIRM is a
robust and reliable planning framework. It is robust since the solution is a feedback and there is no need for expensive
replanning. It is reliable because accurate collision probabilities can be computed along the edges. In addition, FIRM is
a scalable framework, where the complexity of planning with FIRM is a constant multiplier of the complexity of planning
with PRM. In this paper, FIRM is introduced as an abstract framework. As a concrete instantiation of FIRM, we adopt
stationary linear quadratic Gaussian (SLQG) controllers as belief stabilizers and introduce the so-called SLQG-FIRM. In
SLQG-FIRM we focus on kinematic systems and then extend to dynamical systems by sampling in the equilibrium space.
We investigate the performance of SLQG-FIRM in different scenarios.},

requires the solution of a stochastic control problem
in the space of feedback policies. In this paper, by restricting
the policy class to the linear feedback polices, we reduce the
general (n2 + n)-dimensional belief space planning problem
to an (n)-dimensional problem. As opposed to the previous
literature that search in the space of open-loop optimal control
policies, we obtain this reduction in the space of closed-loop
policies by obtaining a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG)
design with the best nominal performance. Then, by taking
the entire underlying trajectory of the LQG controller as the
decision variable, we pose a coupled design of the trajectory
and estimator (while keeping the design of the controller
separate) as a NonLinear Program (NLP) that can be solved
by a general NLP solver. We prove that under a first-order
approximation and a careful usage of the separation principle,
our approximations are valid. We provide an analysis on the
existing major belief space planning methods and show that
our algorithm keeps the lowest computational burden while
searching in the policy space. Finally, we extend our solution

@article{RaihanChakravorty18,
	abstract = {Recursive estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems is an important problem that arises in several engineering applications. It
is well known that the posterior state estimates in nonlinear problems may assume non-Gaussian multimodal densities. In the
past, Gaussian mixture lters and particle lters were introduced to handle non-Gaussianity and nonlinearity. However, these
methods have found only limited success as most Gaussian mixture lters attempt to x the number of mixture modes during
the estimation process, and the particle lters suer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a particle
based Gaussian mixture ltering approach for nonlinear estimation that is free of the particle depletion problem inherent to
most particle lters. We employ an ensemble of possible state realizations for the propagation of state probability density. A
Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the propagated uncertainty is then recovered by clustering the ensemble. The posterior
density is obtained subsequently through a Kalman measurement update of the mixture modes. We prove the convergence
in probability of the resultant density to the true lter density assuming exponential forgetting of initial conditions by the
true lter. The performance of the proposed ltering approach is demonstrated through several test cases and is extensively
compared to other nonlinear lters. The particle Gaussian mixture lter is capable of handling the non-Gaussianity of the state
pdf arising from dynamics, initial conditions or process noise. A more general approach that can also handle non-Gaussianity
related to measurement update is presented in a companion paper.},

ight testing of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) outdoors is heavily restricted
particularly in urban environments and obtaining a certicate of authorization from
the FAA is quite cumbersome. Indoor 
ight testing with localization data can be cost
prohibitive because of the large investment associated with motion capture systems. An
alternative, low-cost solution was developed and tested in which an on-board camera
is used to provide the absolute position of the vehicle in an indoor environment. For
this system, an on-board camera is attached to the underside of a UAS and is used to
track markers that are placed on the ground in a known pattern. Using the camera and
developed software technique, the UAS can gather absolute positioning information by
measuring its position relative to the markers. One of the discussed congurations of
the system can be implemented for $125 on nearly any UAS capable of lifting a 0:26
kg payload. Flight test verication was performed in which the inexpensive positioning
system was compared with a high-accuracy commercial motion capture system. Results
demonstrate the camera system is capable of providing high accuracy localization

Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are still gaining popularity in
civilian and military applications, as much as for personal use.
Such emerging interest is pushing the development of effective
collision avoidance systems. Such systems play a critical role
UAVs operations especially in a crowded airspace setting.
Because of cost and weight limitations associated with UAVs
payload, camera based technologies are the de-facto choice
for collision avoidance navigation systems. This requires multitarget
detection and tracking algorithms from a video, which
can be run on board efficiently. While there has been a great
deal of research on object detection and tracking from a
stationary camera, few have attempted to detect and track small
UAVs from a moving camera.
In this paper, we present a new approach to detect and
track UAVs from a single camera mounted on a different UAV.
Initially, we estimate background motions via a perspective
transformation model and then identify distinctive points in
the background subtracted image. We find spatio-temporal
traits of each moving object through optical flow matching
and then classify those candidate targets based on their motion
patterns compared with the background. The performance
is boosted through Kalman filter tracking. This results in
temporal consistency among the candidate detections. The
algorithm was validated on video datasets taken from a UAV.
Results show that our algorithm can effectively detect and track
small UAVs with limited computing resources.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this article, efcient computational models for
ship motions are presented. These models are used to simulate
ship movements in real time. Compared with traditional
approaches, our method possesses the ability to cope with different
ship shapes, engines, and sea conditions without the
loss of efciency. Based on our models, we create a ship
motion simulation system for both entertainment and educational
applications. Our system assist users to learn the motions
of a ship when encountering waves, currents, and winds.
Users can adjust engine powers, rudders, and other ship facilities
via a graphical user interface to create their own ship
models. They can also change the environment by altering
wave frequencies, wave amplitudes, wave directions, currents,
and winds. Therefore, numerous combinations of ships and
the environment are generated and the learning becomes more
amusing. In our system, a ship is treated as a rigid body oating
on the sea surface. Its motions compose of six degrees of
freedom: pitch, heave, roll, surge, sway, and yaw. These motions
are divided into two categories. The rst three movements
are induced by sea waves, and the last three ones are
caused by propellers, rudders, currents, and winds. Based on
Newton's laws and other basic physics motion models, we deduce
algorithms to compute the magnitudes of the motions.
Our methods can be carried out in real time and possess high
delity. According to ship theory, the net effects of external
forces on the ship hull depends on the ship shape. Therefore,
the behaviors of the ship are inuenced by its shape. To enhance
our physics models, we classify ships into three basic
types. They are at ships, thin ships, and slender ships. Each
type of ship is associated with some predened parameters
to specify their characteristics. Users can tune ship behaviors
by varying the parameters even though they have only a little
knowledge of ship theory.},

For the benefit of community, we have made the implementation

Many current methods use transponders to self-report state information and augment track identification. While conformant aircraft typically report transponder information to alert surrounding aircraft of its state, vehicles may exist in the airspace that are non-compliant and need to be accurately tracked using alternative methods. In this study, a multi-agent tracking solution is presented that solely utilizes primary surveillance radar data to estimate aircraft state information. Main research challenges include state estimation, track management, data association, and establishing persistent track validity. In an effort to realize these challenges, techniques such as Maximum a Posteriori estimation, Kalman filtering, degree of membership data association, and Nearest Neighbor Spanning Tree clustering are implemented for this application.},

of inter-map loop closures in multi-robot simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). Existing robust SLAM
methods assume a good initialization or an ``odometry backbone''
to classify inlier and outlier loop closures. In the
multi-robot case, these assumptions do not always hold. This
paper presents an algorithm called Pairwise Consistency Maximization
(PCM) that estimates the largest pairwise internally
consistent set of measurements. Finding the largest pairwise
internally consistent set can be transformed into an instance
of the maximum clique problem from graph theory, and by
leveraging the associated literature it can be solved in realtime.
This paper evaluates how well PCM approximates the
combinatorial gold standard using simulated data. It also
evaluates the performance of PCM on synthetic and real-world
data sets in comparison with DCS, SCGP, and RANSAC, and
shows that PCM significantly outperforms these methods.},

The largest clique of potential matches are then found and map optimization is performed. It is a nice paper with very reasonable solutions to hard problems.

	abstract = {The RANSAC framework is often used to estimate the relative pose of two cameras from outlier-contaminated point correspondences, via the essential matrix, however this is computationally expensive due the cost of computing essential matrices from many sets of five to seven correspondences. The leading contemporary 5-point solver (Nister, 2004) is slow because of the expensive linear algebra decompositions and polynomial solve which are required. To avoid these costs we propose to use Levenberg-Marquardt optimisation on a manifold to find a subset of the compatible essential matrices. The proposed algorithm finds essential matrices at a higher rate than closed-form approaches, and reduces the time needed to find relative poses using RANSAC by 25%. The second contribution of this paper is to apply the optimisations used in 5-point solvers to the classic 7-point algorithm. RANSAC using the optimised 7-point algorithm is considerably faster than 5-point RANSAC (unless planar point configurations are common), despite the increased number of iterations necessary.},

	abstract = {Abstract---We describe an approach to object retrieval which
searches for and localizes all the occurrences of an object in
a video, given a query image of the object. The object is
represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors
so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes
in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal
continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions
in order to reject those that are unstable.
Efficient retrieval is achieved by employing methods from
statistical text retrieval, including inverted file systems, and
text and document frequency weightings. This requires a visual
analogy of a word which is provided here by vector quantizing the
region descriptors. The final ranking also depends on the spatial
layout of the regions. The result is that retrieval is immediate,
returning a ranked list of shots in the manner of Google [6].
We report results for object retrieval on the full length
feature films `Groundhog Day', `Casablanca' and `Run Lola
Run', including searches from within the movie and specified by
external images downloaded from the Internet. We investigate
retrieval performance with respect to different quantizations
of region descriptors and compare the performance of several
ranking measures. Performance is also compared to a baseline

sensitive to the depth estimation allowing for a faster method to
obtain this estimate. To enhance velocity tracking of the sliding

motion over a small number of initial images, a recursive
version of the algorithm (previously reported) recomputes
sub-optimal estimates given new image data.
The algorithm is designed ezplicitly for real-tame implementation,
and the completity is proportional to the
number of tracked features. 3D projective, afine and
Euclidean models of structure and motion recovery have
been implemented, incorporating both point and line features
into the computation. The framework can handle
any feature type and camera model that may be encapsulated
as a projection equation from scene to image.},

	abstract = {Abstract---To estimate the relative pose of two cameras from
outlier-contaminated feature correspondences, the essential matrix
and inlier set is estimated using RANSAC, then this estimate
is refined to minimise an error function on the correspondences.
This paper evaluates several refinement methods which minimise
functions of Sampson's error. All perform well on large sets of
correspondences or when inlier rates are high, but many perform
poorly or fail when the inlier set found by RANSAC is small; this
is shown to be because the inlier sets contain remaining outliers,
while missing some inliers.
The most accurate solutions are given by minimising the robust
Blake-Zisserman function of Sampson's error, although this
provides only a minimal improvement in accuracy compared with
least squares refinement. The most reliable results are given by
nonlinear optimisation constrained to the essential manifold. An
efficient parametrisation of the essential manifold as a quaternion
and a unit vector is described; applying Iteratively Reweighted
Least Squares combined with Levenberg-Marquardt optimisation
on this manifold takes typically less than one millisecond.},

possible solutions for relative camera pose between two calibrated views given five corresponding points. The algorithm consists of
computing the coefficients of a tenth degree polynomial in closed form and, subsequently, finding its roots. It is the first algorithm wellsuited
for numerical implementation that also corresponds to the inherent complexity of the problem. We investigate the numerical
precision of the algorithm. We also study its performance under noise in minimal as well as overdetermined cases. The performance is
compared to that of the well-known 8 and 7-point methods and a 6-point scheme. The algorithm is used in a robust hypothesize-andtest
framework to estimate structure and motion in real-time with low delay. The real-time system uses solely visual input and has been
demonstrated at major conferences},

Initialization:  The paper assumes that an external source initializes the tracks.  The number of tracks is known a priori.

- objects are identified as single points using some computer vision technique: SIFT, SURF, etc.

Algorithm:
- for each existing track, find nearest measurement.   Measurements not paired are assumed to be outlers.   
- Then for each nearest measurement, find nearest track.  Tracks not paired are assumed occluded.
- When pairing is made, update Kalman track.  Otherwise, propagate using predictor.
- Camera motion is estimated using the average of target motion, since targets are assumed to be stationary.

Disadvantage:
- No track initialization.
- Can't handle new targets.
- Data association is like nearest neighbor and so there will be many missed detections.
- Difficulty handling moving targets.

There is only simulated data with non-real images (Matlab).

functions for systems that are almost globally asymptotically stable (i.e.,
systems for which all trajectories converge to an equilibrium except for a
set of measure zero) using navigation functions (NFs). Although recentlyproven
converse theorems guarantee the existence of density functions for
such systems, such results are only existential and the construction of a
density function for almost globally asymptotically stable systems remains
a challenging task. We show that for a specific class of dynamical systems
that are defined based on an NF, a density function can be easily derived
from the system's underlying NF.

We also show how the attitude can be estimated under a relaxed persistency-of-excitation condition, with a single vector measurement as a special case. Next, we use the attitude observer to construct a globally exponentially stable observer for gnss/ins integration, based on accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer measurements, as well as gnss measurements of position and (optionally) velocity. We verify the stability properties of the design using experimental data from a light fixed-wing aircraft.},

notably orientations in 3D, S is not a vector space, but a so-called manifold, i.e. it behaves like a vector

several ad-hoc approaches have been proposed.
Here, we present a principled solution to this problem where the structure of the manifold S is
encapsulated by two operators, state displacement  : S  Rn ! S and its inverse  : S  S ! Rn.
These operators provide a local vector-space view  7! x around a given state x. Generic estimation
algorithms can then work on the manifold S mainly by replacing  with / where appropriate. We
analyze these operators axiomatically, and demonstrate their use in least-squares estimation and the
Unscented Kalman Filter. Moreover, we exploit the idea of encapsulation from a software engineering
perspective in the Manifold Toolkit, where the / operators mediate between a \
at-vector view
for the generic algorithm and a \named-members view for the problem specic functions.},

for autonomous, uncertainty--aware exploration and
mapping of unknown environments using aerial robots. The
proposed planner follows a two--step, receding horizon, belief
space--based approach. At first, in an online computed tree the
algorithm finds the branch that optimizes the amount of space
expected to be explored. The first viewpoint configuration of this
branch is selected, but the path towards it is decided through
a second planning step. Within that, a new tree is sampled,
admissible branches arriving at the reference viewpoint are
found and the robot belief about its state and the tracked
landmarks of the environment is propagated. The branch that
minimizes the expected localization and mapping uncertainty is
selected, the corresponding path is executed by the robot and
the whole process is iteratively repeated. The proposed planner
is capable of running online onboard a small aerial robot and
its performance is evaluated using experimental studies in a
challenging environment.},

Pontryagin's maximum principle Comments: An approximation method
is presented to construct an optimal state regulator for a nonlinear
system with quadratic performance index. The nonlinearity is taken
to be a perturbation to the system, and a parameter $\epsilon$ is
introduced to stand for it. By making use of a power-series expansion
in $\epsilon$, a sequence of partial differential equations is derived
whose solutions form a subopimal feedback law. Given a polynomial
nonlinearity, the partial differential equations are reduced to ordinary
differential equations by separation of variables. The zero-order
terms yield a well known Riccati equation. Higher-order equations
are transformed into conventional type linear equations, owing to
a lemma regarding an extended Liapunov equation. It is demonstrated
that the l-th order approximation for the feedback law results
in the (2l+1)th order approximation to the optimal performance.

The procedure developed has a wide variety of applications. As one
of the straightforward applications, the synthesis of a suboptimal
control is discussed for a large-scale system as composed of several
subsystems of lower dimensions.

Three examples attached illustrate several features of the method.

for the application of classical estimation techniques, e.g.,

	abstract = {In this work, we study the inconsistency problem of extended Kalman
filter (EKF)-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from
the perspective of observability. We analytically prove that when
the Jacobians of the process and measurement models are evaluated
at the latest state estimates during every time step, the linearized
error-state system employed in the EKF has an observable subspace
of dimension higher than that of the actual, non-linear, SLAM system.
As a result, the covariance estimates of the EKF undergo reduction
in directions of the state space where no information is available,
which is a primary cause of the inconsistency. Based on these theoretical
results, we propose a general framework for improving the consistency
of EKF-based SLAM. In this framework, the EKF linearization points
are selected in a way that ensures that the resulting linearized
system model has an observable subspace of appropriate dimension.
We describe two algorithms that are instances of this paradigm. In
the first, termed observability constrained (OC)-EKF, the linearization
points are selected so as to minimize their expected errors (i.e.
the difference between the linearization point and the true state)
under the observability constraints. In the second, the filter Jacobians
are calculated using the first-ever available estimates for all state
variables. This latter approach is termed first-estimates Jacobian
(FEJ)-EKF. The proposed algorithms have been tested both in simulation
and experimentally, and are shown to significantly outperform the
standard EKF both in terms of accuracy and consistency.},

with range and bearing estimates, the nonlinear observability analysis
shows that there are three unobservable modes (position and orientation).
However, when the system is linearized to be used in the extended
Kalman filter, the linearized system only has two unobservable modes.
In other words, the linear system thinks that it has more information
then it really has.

The authors postulate that the change in observable modes is what
causes the filter to become inconsistent. They also design two modifications
that select different points to linearize the system, and show that
at those points, observability does not change. With the new modifications,
the filter remains consistent.

limitation of such systems is the need to fly very tight circles
at high-lift coefficients. This limits the size of the payload that
can be retrieved with such a system. To overcome this, it is possible
to employ a multiple-aircraft, multiple-cable system to allow greater
control of the payload position as well as allowing a much wider
choice of aircraft speed and lift coefficient. In this paper, an
object-oriented cable modeling approach is used to study the relative
equilibria of such a system. Parametric studies of different payload
masses and aircraft orbit parameters are presented, and the dynamic
stability is analyzed. Collision-free transition trajectories that
take the multiple-aircraft system from circular flight into straight
and level flight are derived.},

When the number of targets is fixed, the single-scan version of MCMCDA approximates joint probabilistic data association (JPDA). Although the exact computation of association probabili- ties in JPDA is NP-hard, we prove that the single-scan MCMCDA algorithm provides a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme for JPDA. For general multi-target tracking problems, in which unknown numbers of targets appear and disappear at random times, we present a multi-scan MCMCDA algorithm that approximates the optimal Bayesian filter. We also present extensive simulation studies supporting theoretical results in this paper. Our simulation results also show that MCMCDA outperforms multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) by a significant margin in terms of accuracy and efficiency under extreme conditions, such as a large number of targets in a dense environment, low detection probabilities, and high false alarm rates.},

The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

the resolution and accuracy of the model. This study evaluates the resolution and accuracy of 3D point cloud models
of a large landslide that occurred in 2013 near Page, Arizona that were developed from various small UAV platform
and camera configurations. Terrestrial laser scans (TLS) were performed at the landslide and were used to establish a
comparative baseline model. Results from the study indicate that point cloud resolution improved by more than 16{\%}
when using multi-rotor UAVs instead of fixed-wing UAVs. However, accuracy of the points in the point cloud model
appear to be independent of the UAV platform, but depend principally on the selected camera and the image resolution.
Additional practical guidance on flying various UAV platforms in challenging field conditions is provided for geologists

	abstract = {Over the last 20-30 years, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has
become the algorithm of choice in numerous nonlinear estimation and
machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a
nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear
system identification (eg, learning the weights of a neural network).
The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a
linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is
sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. (1997),
proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free
alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state
estimation. This was extended to parameter estimation by Wan and Van der
Merwe et al., (2000). The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms
of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity
of (OL{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}){\textless}sup{\textgreater}l{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} for general state-space problems. When
the EKF is applied to parameter estimation, the special form of the
state-space equations allows for an O(L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) implementation.
This paper introduces the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF)
which is also O(L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) for general state estimation and
O(L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) for parameter estimation (note the original formulation
of the UKF for parameter-estimation was O(L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sup{\textgreater})). In addition,
the square-root forms have the added benefit of numerical stability and

Kalman filtered to produce the range estimate. The range estimate
appears to be accurate when the rotation rates are small, allowing
accurate estimates of the image gradiants. A 3D Sobel operator is
used to estimate the spatial and temporal gradiants in the image.
It appears that this method should allow us to estimate rate without
using a GPS sensor. Velocity would need to be determined by integrating
the accelerometers.

	abstract = {In this paper we describe a scalable algorithm for the simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM) problem. SLAM is the problem of acquiring a map of a static environment with a mobile robot. The vast majority of SLAM algorithms are based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). In this paper we advocate an algorithm that relies on the dual of the EKF, the extended information filter (EIF). We show that when represented in the information form, map posteriors are dominated by a small number of links that tie together nearby features in the map. This insight is developed into a sparse variant of the EIF, called the sparse extended information filter (SEIF). SEIFs represent maps by graphical networks of features that are locally interconnected, where links represent relative information between pairs of nearby features, as well as information about the robot's pose relative to the map. We show that all essential update equations in SEIFs can be executed in constant time, irrespective of the size of the map. We also provide empirical results obtained for a benchmark data set collected in an outdoor environment, and using a multi-robot mapping simulation.},

Theory, George Saridis, Upper bounds, Comments: In this thesis, a
design method is proposed to iteratively improve the performance
of a given suboptimal, admissible feedback control law for a deterministic
nonlinear system. In the case of the nonlinear regulator problem,
the method is shown to lead to successively improved, asymptotically
stable control laws. These control laws are also robust with respect
to parameter variations in the system equation and variations in
the control actuator gains. Moreover, unlike the methods proposed
in the past, the design method requires only the determination of
upper bounds to the performance of a given control law and not the
actual value function itself. This provides a degree of flexibility,
leading to a solution method for finding the upper bound functions
as a Lipschitz continuous tensor product spline function obtained
by solving a linear programming problem. The design method is demonstrated
by developing successively improved controllers for mechanical manipulator
arm. },

	abstract = {Abstract�The use of accelerometer and gyro observations

in a visual SLAM implementation is beneficial especially in

high dynamic situations. The downside of using inertial is that

traditionally high prediction rates are required as observations

are provided at high sample rates. An accurate orientation and

velocity estimate must also be maintained at all times in order

to integrate the inertial observations and correct for the effect

of gravity.

This paper presents a way to pre-integrate the high rate

inertial observations without the need for an initial orientation

or velocity estimate. This allows for a slower filter prediction

rate and use of inertial observations when the initial velocity

and attitude of the platform are unknown. Additionally the

initial velocity and roll and pitch of the platform become

observable over time and an estimate of these values is provided

by the filter. An estimate of the gravity vector is also provided.

Results are presented using a delayed state information

smoother implementation however due to the linearity of the

equations this technique can be applied to extended Kalman

filter (EKF) implementations just as easily.},

Space vehicle attitude control system performance is often limited
by the computational speed of airborne digital computer hardware.
The applicatio of quaternions to digital attitude control problems
involving coordinate system transformations can reduce computation
time by more than 40{\%} over the equivalent direction cosine matrix
solution due to a new method of treating quaternions which allows
the order of multiplication to be interchanged so as to isolate the
most rapidly varying parameters. This paper presents a formulation
for control equations in which the control error is expressed as
a quaternion and all coordinate system tranformations are performed
using quaterions. The new principle of `quaternion algebra' which
allows interchanging the order of multiplication is developed and
used to simplify the control equations. The quaternion control equations
are applied to a three-gimbal IMU example and the results are compared
to an equivalent direction cosine matrix solution. },

	abstract = {Abstract---In this paper the problem of localize two mobile robots is considered. The robots are equipped with proprioceptive sensors (like encoders) and exteroceptive sensors able to provide relative observations between them. In these observations, one robot detects and identifies the other one and measures some relative quantity. An observability analysis is performed by taking into account the system nonlinearities and for four different relative observations. The theoretical results are validated by simulations and experiments carried out on real platforms. In these experiments, an Extended Kalman Filter is adopted to fuse the information coming from the encoders and the sensors performing the observations. My comments-- This paper provides a nonlinear analysis of observability for relative robot kinematics. It should be of interest to David Wheeler's work. The paper is not very clear in the fact that the input variable is not included in the observability analysis. If the input variable is a function of x, then it should impact the observability analysis. In essense the paper only considers the case when the inputs are constant.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {{\AA}} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{{\%}} with default Glide SP settings to 58{{\%}} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{{\%}} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{{\%}} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {The goal of this article is to review the state-of-the-art tracking methods, classify them into different categories, and identify new trends. Object tracking, in general, is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid object structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. Moreover, we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features, selection of motion models, and detection of objects.},

It considers the performance of the air vehicle as well as mission specific requirements including the avoidance of no-fly areas, risk reduction in threat environments by terrain following flight or terrain masking low-level flight, and other regulations such as fixed release and approach vectors at the start and destination locations. The focus of the approach is on a proper discretization of the airspace by a network which allows the application of standard algorithms of combinatorial optimization. In contrast to conventional discretizations by grids or grid-like graphs, our network is non-regular since created by some random process. Moreover, each path in the network corresponds to a twice continuously differentiable trajectory which obeys the kinematic restrictions of the air vehicle and which is feasible with respect to the operational requirements of the mission. With suitable costs defined on the edges of the network, a minimum-cost path calculation allows to identify a trajectory of shortest length, shortest flight time, minimum flight height, or minimum visibility from the ground. The latter objectives aim to minimize the probability of being detected by hostile forces, hence increasing the survivability of the air vehicle.},

issues of analysis and design. In this paper it is shown that there
exist orthogonal functions that, in a natural way, are generated
by stable linear dynamical systems and that compose an orthonormal
basis for the signal space ln2. To this end, use is made of balanced
realizations of inner tranfer functions. The orthogonal functions
can be considered as generalizations of, e.g., the pulse functions,
Laguerre functions, and Kautz functions, and give rise to an alternative
series expansion of rational transfer functions. It is shown how
we can exploit these generalized basis functions to increase the
speed of convergence in a series expansion, i.e., to obtain a good
approximation by retaining only a finite number of expansion coefficients.
Consequences for identification of expansion coefficients are analyzed,
and a bound is formulated on the error that is made when approximating
a system by a finite number of expansion coefficents. },

the problem by assuming the target performs a random walk,

which both aides in the computation of a smooth value function

and further accounts for all realizations of target kinematics.

A Bellman equation based on an approximating Markov chain

that is consistent with the stochastic kinematics is used to

compute a control policy that minimizes the expected value of

a cost function based on a nominal UAV-target distance. Our

results indicate how uncertainty in the target motion affects

the control law, and simulations illustrate that the control can

further be applied to any continuous, smooth trajectory with

no need for further computation.},

	abstract = {A quaternion-based attitude control system is developed for the
X-33 in the ascent flight phase. A nonlinear control law commands
body-axis rotation rates that align the angular velocity vector with an
Euler-axis defining the axis of rotation that takes the body-axis system
into a desired-axis system. The magnitudes of the commanded body rates
are determined by the magnitude of the rotation error The commanded body
rates form the input to a dynamic inversion-based
adaptive/reconfigurable control law. The indirect adaptive control
portion uses online system identification to estimate the current
control effectiveness matrix to update a control allocation module. The
control allocation nominally operates in a minimum deflection mode;
however, if a fault is detected, it can operate in a null-space
injection mode that excites and decorrelates the effecters without
degrading the vehicle response in order to enable online system
identification. The overall system is designed to provide fault and
damage tolerance for the X-33 on ascent. The baseline control law
supports full envelope operation and eliminates trajectory dependent
gain-scheduling that is typically found on this type of vehicle.
Preliminary results are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach},

Like the Bayesian single-target filter, the PHD recursion also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Although sequential Monte Carlo implementations have demonstrated the potential of the PHD filter, so far no closed-form solutions have yet been developed. In this paper, an analytic solution to the PHD recursion is proposed for linear Gaussian target dynamics with Gaussian births.

	abstract = {We consider the task of depth estimation from a single monocular image.
We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which
we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured
outdoor environments which include forests, trees, buildings, etc.)
and their corresponding ground-truth depthmaps. Then, we apply supervised
learning to predict the depthmap as a function of the image. Depth
estimation is a challenging problem, since local features alone are
insufficient to estimate depth at a point, and one needs to consider
the global context of the image. Our model uses a discriminatively-trained
Markov Random Field (MRF) that incorporates multiscale local- and
global-image features, and models both depths at individual points
as well as the relation between depths at different points. We show
that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm is frequently able
to recover fairly accurate depthmaps.},

Passivity, Linear Matrix Inequalities, Flexible Beam Comments: The
so-called smart structures frequently have more sensors than actuators,
due to the lower cost and simpler instumentation. The passivity based
controller, which is frequently used in structural control due to
its inherent robustness properties, requires sensor-actuator collocation;
therefore, it can at best utilize only a subset of the sensors. This
paper considers the design of a `squaring down' matrix which would
render a system passive subject to some aditional performance considerations.
This problem is cast as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)
which can be efficiently solved due to the recent advance in interior
point methods in convex programming. We applied this procedure with
the assumption that the sensors provide displcement as well as velocity
information which is generally not true. We show that the proposed
scheme can be implemented without the use of such velocity information.
Simulation results involving a single flexible beam with torque input

The analysis is based on a novel formulation of the SLAM problem, that enables the simultaneous estimation of the landmark coordinates with respect to the a robot-centered frame (relative map), as well as with respect to a fixed global frame (absolute map). A study of the properties of the covariance matrix in this formulation yields analytical upper bounds for the uncertainty of both map representations. Moreover, by employing results from Least Squares estimation theory, the guaranteed accuracy of the robot pose estimates is derived as a function of the accuracy of the robots sensors, and of the properties of the map. Contrary to previous approaches, the method presented here makes no assumptions about the availability of a sensor measuring the absolute orientation of the robot. The theoretical analysis is validated by simulation results and real-world experiments. 1},

Comments: This paper analyzes the formation control problem using
a behavioral approach. The behavior of the group is influenced by
the presence of virtual leaders which can be used to shape the final
formations. It is shown how to get triangle, line, and circle formations.
Schooling and flocking behaviors are analyzed. A schooling maneuver
is defined as 'a steady group translation, e.g., where the center
of mass of the group translates.' A flocking maneuver is defined
as 'a motion in which the vehicles circle a stationary point such
that the center of mass of the group is stationary. Lyapunov analysis
is used to guarantee stability of these maneuvers. A nice paper.

does not require including the 3D feature position in the state

The vision-aided inertial navigation algorithm we propose has
computational complexity only linear in the number of features,

	abstract = {There are many algorithms developed for tracking and detecting faint moving objects in congested backgrounds. One obvious application is detection of targets in images where each pixel corresponds to the received power in a particular location. In our application, a visible imager operated in stare mode observes geostationary objects as fixed, stars as moving and non-geostationary objects as drifting in the field of view. We would like to achieve high sensitivity detection of the drifters. The ability to improve SNR with ``track-before-detect (TBD)'' processing, where target information is collected and collated before the detection decision is made, allows respectable performance against dim moving objects. Generally, a TBD algorithm consists of a pre-processing stage that highlights potential targets and a temporal filtering stage. However, the algorithms that have been successfully demonstrated, e.g. Viterbi-based and Bayesian-based, demand formidable processing power and memory. We propose an algorithm that exploits the quasi constant velocity of objects, the predictability of the stellar clutter and the intrinsically low false alarm rate of detecting signature candidates in 3-D, based on an iterative method called RANdom SAmple Consensus'' and one that can run real-time on a typical PC. The technique is tailored for searching objects with small telescopes in stare mode. Our RANSAC-MT (Moving Target) algorithm estimates parameters of a mathematical model (e.g., linear motion) from a set of observed data which contains a significant number of outliers while identifying inliers. In the pre-processing phase, candidate blobs were selected based on morphology and an intensity threshold that would normally generate unacceptable level of false alarms. The RANSAC sampling rejects candidates that conform to the predictable motion of the stars. Data collected with a 17 inch telescope by AFRL/RH and a COTS lens/EM-CCD sensor by the AFRL/RD Satellite Assessment Center is used to assess the performance of the algorithm. In the second application, a visible imager operated in sidereal mode observes geostationary objects as moving, stars as fixed except for field rotation, and non-geostationary objects as drifting. RANSAC-MT is used to detect the drifter. In this set of data, the drifting space object was detected at a distance of 13800 km. The AFRL/RH set of data, collected in the stare mode, contained the signature of two geostationary satellites. The signature of a moving object was simulated and added to the sequence of frames to determine the sensitivity in magnitude. The performance compares well with the more intensive TBD algorithms reported in the literature.},

First, it does not operate on batch data, but rather on sequential data received in real-time. Second, R-RANSAC can incorporate any motion model and not just linear data since it essentially establishesa bank of Kalman filters for each potential model.},

	abstract = {When the towpoint of an aerial cable system moves in a tight circular
path, the drogue at the cable tip moves

towards the center of the circle, and its altitude decreases relative
to its equilibrium position in forward flight. Such a

system has both military and civilian applications, including remote
pickup and delivery of payloads. This work

studies the transitional dynamics of such a system as the aircraft
changes from straight flight to circular flight. The

system dynamics are modeled using a discretized cable model, allowing
the cable to take on zero tension values.

Numerical simulation results show that the cable becomes slack during
the transition if the aircraft turns too rapidly.

Parametric studies of the towpath are performed for both tow-in and
tow-out maneuvers. Tension waves can be

reduced by appropriate control of the towpoint. Simulated annealing
is used to optimize some parameters used to

specify the tow-in maneuver. Alternatively, a deployment controller
is developed using fuzzy logic that avoids some of

these problems by deploying the cable while the aircraft orbits. Instability
of deployment for certain combinations of

cable length and length rate are observed.},

fixed-wing UAV to another in a team of UAVs, using onboard

uses optical measurements from cameras onboard a vehicle,
to estimate both the relative pose and relative velocities of
another vehicle or target object. It is obtained by applying the
Lagrange-d'Alembert principle to a Lagrangian constructed
from measurement residuals using only the optical measurements.
This nonlinear pose estimation scheme is discretized
for computer implementation using the discrete Lagranged'Alembert

obtaining relative velocity estimates from optical measurements.

the path planning algorithm is designed to generate paths

using multiple vehicle collaboration, a decentralized planning

is used to mean localizing the robot in the surrounding environment.
{\%} The introduction discusses two types of vision based localization:
Landmark based methods where a known landmark in the scene is used
to triangulate the position, and Natural Feature-based methods, where
natural features are tracked using stereo cameras to track differential
motion. {\%} An novel binary corner detection algorithm that is 1.6
times faster than a Harris corner detector is discussed. {\%} The corner
detector is used to reconstruct the 3-D world coordinates. Since
lenses lead to image warping, the image has to be unwarped. However,
the unwarping process can lead to strange artifacts in the unwarped
image. Instead of unwarping the image and then reconstructing the
3-D location, in this paper the features are tracked in the warped
image and then projected back through the unwarping process. {\%} Features
are tracked using a normalized mean-squared differences metric. {\%}
Motion is estimated using optic flow, which is found using least-squares
minimization. {\%} The position of the robot is tracked using a Kalman
filter. Also, the position of each feature is tracked using a seperate
Kalman filter for each feature. {\%} Experimental results are demonstrated
on short closed paths using a mobile robot in an outdoor environment.

	abstract = {Autopilot systems are capable of reliably following flight plans under normal circumstances, but even the most advanced flight-management systems cannot provide robust response to most anomalous events including in-flight failures. This paper describes an emergency flight-management architecture that can be applied to piloted or autonomous aircraft, with focus on the design and implementation of an adaptive flight planner (AFP) that dynamically adjusts its model to compute feasible flight plans in response to events that degrade aircraft performance. A two-step landing-site selection/trajectory generation process defines safe emergency plans in real time for situations that require landing at an alternate airport. A constraint-based search algorithm selects and prioritizes feasible emergency landing sites, then the AFP synthesizes a segmented trajectory to the best site based on postfailure flight dynamics. The AFP architecture is general for any failure situation; however, operational success is guaranteed only with accurate postfailure performance characterization and a trajectory generation strategy that respects degraded flight envelope boundaries. A real-time segmented trajectory planning algorithm and case study results are presented for total loss of thrust failure scenarios. This emergency is surprisingly common and necessitates an immediate approach and landing without a go-around option.},

@article{Lowe04,
	abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant
features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching
between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant
to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching
across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint,
addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly
distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly
matched with high probability against a large database of features
from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using
these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by
matching individual features to a database of features from known
objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough
transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and
finally performing verification through least-squares solution for
consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly
identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near
real-time performance.},

@article{LaValle1998,
	abstract = {These notes provide a brief introduction to the theory of noncooperative differential games. After the Introduction, Section 2 reviews the theory of static games. Differentc oncepts of solution are discussed, including Pareto optima, Nash and Stackelberg equilibria, and the co-co (cooperative-competitive) solutions. Section 3 introduces the basic framework of differential games for two players. Open-loop solutions, where the controls implemented by the players depend only on time, are considered in Section 4. It is shownthat Nash and Stackelberg solutions can be computed by solving a two-point boundary value problem for a system of ODEs, derived from the Pontryagin maximum principle.Section 5 deals with solutions in feedback form, where the controls are allowed to depend on time and also on the current state of the system. In this case, the search for Nash equilibrium solutions usually leads to a highly nonlinear system of Hamilton Jacobi PDEs. In dimension higher than one, this system is generically not hyperbolic and the Cauchy problem is thus ill posed. Due to this instability, closed-loop solutions to differential games are mainly considered in the special case with linear dynamics and quadratic costs. In Section 6, a game in continuous time is approximated by a finite sequence of static games, by a time discretization. Depending of the type of solution adopted in each static game, one obtains different concept of solutions for the original differential game. Section 7 deals with differential games in infinite time horizon, with exponentially discounted payoffs. In this case, the search for Nash solutions in feedback form leads to a system of time-independent H-J equations. Section 8 contains a simple example of a game with infinitely many players. This is intended to convey a flavor of the newly emerging theory of mean field games. Modeling issues, and directions of current research, are briefly discussed in Section 9. Finally, the Appendix collects background material on multivalued functions, selections and fixed point theorems, optimal control theory, and hyperbolic PDEs.},

is taken. These algorithms are applied in simulation scenarios for

	abstract = { As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered for a wider variety
of military and commercial applications, the ability to navigate
autonomously in unknown and hazardous environments is increasingly
vital to the effectiveness of UAVs. Reliable and efficient obstacle
detection is a fundamental prerequisite to performing autonomous
navigation in an unknown environment. Traditional two-dimensional
(planar) obstacle detection techniques, though computationally friendly,
are often insufficient for safe navigation through complex environments
in which commanded trajectories are restricted vertically by overhanging
obstacles or increases in terrain elevation. To this end, a pan/tilt-mounted
laser rangefinder is explored as a means of identifying and characterizing
potential obstacles in three dimensions (3D). From GPS position data
and inertial sensor measurements, the filtered laser rangefinder
data are transformed into local inertial coordinates and compiled
into a dynamic three-dimensional grid-based mapping of the specified
domain. The Georgia Tech GTMax UAV helicopter and simulation environment
provide a suitable test-bed for verification of the proposed obstacle
detection methodology. },

	abstract = {We address the problem of verifying motion plans for aerial robots in uncertain and partially-known environments. Thereby, the initial state of the robot is uncertain due to errors from the state estimation and the motion is uncertain due to wind disturbances and control errors caused by sensor noise. Since the environment is perceived at runtime, the verification of partial motion plans must be performed online (i.e. during operation) to ensure safety within the planning horizon and beyond. This is achieved by efficiently generating robust control invariant sets based on so-called loiter circles, where the position of the aerial robot follows a circular pattern. Verification of aerial robots is challenging due to the nonlinearity of their dynamics, the high dimensionality of their state space, and their potentially high velocities. We use novel techniques from reachability analysis to over-come those challenges. In order to ensure that the robot never finds itself in a situation for which no safe maneuver exists, we provide a technique that ensures safety of aerial robots beyond the planning horizon. Our method is applicable to all kinds of robotic systems that follow reference trajectories, such as bipedal robotic walking, robotic manipulators, automated vehicles, and the like. We evaluate our method by simulations of high speed helicopter flights.},

The implemented filter was tested in synthetic bearings-only tracking

the presence of false alarms and missed measurements. The estimated
target state consisted of 2D position and

velocity components. The filter was capable to track the targets fairly
well despite of the missing measurements

showed robustness against wrong parameter

values of false alarm rates. The results that were obtained during

	abstract = {Abstract---This paper considers the problem of obtaining good

attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low

cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are

characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases.

We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer

kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO(3)

driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements.

Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are

derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error.

The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct

complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal

group a related observer, termed the passive complementary

filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from

the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct

and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online.
The

passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms

of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction

of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the

explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and

gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware;

and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the

gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated

with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed

and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

The position of the nontechnical person is that a liberal education will make engineers better people and better able to understand and respond to the needs of society. American Engineering students, however, are unconvinced and mostly greet such assertions with ridicule and scorn. Both sides are wrong. Exposure to the liberal and the fine arts is important to the education of engineers, but not just to make them better members of society.

Aerial robotics is a fast-growing
field of robotics and multirotor aircraft,

popularity. In fact, quadrotor aerial
robotic vehicles have become a
standard platform for robotics
research worldwide. They already
have sufficient payload and flight
endurance to support a number of
indoor and outdoor applications,
and the improvements of battery
and other technology is rapidly
increasing the scope for commercial
opportunities. They are highly maneuverable
and enable safe and
low-cost experimentation in mapping,
navigation, and control strategies for
robots that move in three-dimensional
(3-D) space. This ability to move in 3-D
space brings new research challenges compared
with the wheeled mobile robots that
have driven mobile robotics research over the
last decade. Small quadrotors have been demonstrated
for exploring and mapping 3-D environments;
transporting, manipulating, and assembling
objects; and acrobatic tricks such as juggling, balancing,
and flips. Additional rotors can be added, leading to generalized
N-rotor vehicles, to improve payload and reliability.},

such as radar are too heavy to mount on a MAV and are often

ultrasonic sensors provide a viable alternative and are light

enough to mount on a MAV. However, each of these sensors

are directional and are often mounted at fixed angles requiring

airframe control to maintain the sensor on a target. We propose

a method of target tracking using a fixed angle camera and

derive a closed-loop guidance strategy to fix the target in the

image frame using the position and velocity of the target in

the image plane to command a heading rate. The resulting

motion of the MAV is an elliptical orbit around the target with

the target positioned at a focus of the ellipse as predicted in

The problem of an invariant continuous-time model with discrete-time measurements is cast into a rigorous stochastic and geometric framework. Building upon the theory of continuous-time invariant observers, we show that, as in the linear case, the error equation is a Markov chain that does not depend on the state estimate. Thus, when the filter's gains are held fixed, and the filter admits almost-global convergence properties with noise turned off, the noisy error's distribution is proved to converge to a stationary distribution, providing insight into the mathematical theory of filtering on Lie groups. For engineering purposes we also introduce the discrete-time Invariant Extended Kalman Filter, for which the trusted covariance matrix is shown to asymptotically converge, and some numerically more involved sample-based methods as well to compute the Kalman gains. The methods are applied to attitude estimation, allowing to derive novel theoretical results in this field, and illustrated through simulations on synthetic data.},

use numerical methods to find the suitable feedback linearizing control
instead of solving for it analytically. The advantage is that an
explicit model with well known coefficients does not need to be known.
The weakness in the paper is that it does not guarantee closed loop
stability of the system especially in the transient, as the numberical
algorithm looks for the root of the appropriate equation.

I attempted to apply the results of this paper to a two dimensional
tailsitter model but without success. However, to be fair, the tailsitter
model does not fit into the form of the equations using in the paper.

@article{BarShalomDaumHuang09,
	abstract = {The measurement selection for updating the state estimate of a target's track, known as data association, is essential for good performance in the presence of spurious measurements or clutter. A classification of tracking and data association approaches has been presented, as a pure MMSE approach, which amounts to a soft decision, and single best-hypothesis approach, which amounts to a hard decision. It has been shown that the optimal state estimator in the presence of data association uncertainty consists of the computation of the conditional pdf of the state x(k) given all information available at time k, namely, the prior information about the initial state, the intervening known inputs, and the sets of measurements through time k. It has also been pointed out that if the exact conditional pdf, which is a mixture, is available, then its recursion requires only the probabilities of the most recent association events. The conditions under which this result holds, namely whiteness of the noise, detection, and clutter processes, were presented. The PDAF and JPDAF algorithms, which carry out data association and state estimation in clutter, have been described. A simple example was given to illustrate how the clutter and occasional missed detections can lead to track loss for a standard tracking filter, and how PDAF can keep the target in track under such circumstances. By using the Monte Carlo in a simulated based surveillance as an exampled shown. The numerous applications of the PDAF/JPDAF illustrated in Real-World Applications of PDAF and JPDAF show the potential pitfalls of using sophisticated algorithms for tracking in difficult environments as well as how to overcome them. The effect of finite sensor resolution can be a more severe problem than the data association and deserves special attention.},

To date, the most common method of handling delayed data in sensing networks has been to use a conservative time alignment of the observation data with the filter time. However, by accounting for the correlation between the late data and the filter over the delayed period, an exact solution is possible. The inclusion of this information correlation term adds little extra complexity, and may be applied in an information filter update stage which is associative. The delayed data algorithm can also be used to handle data that is asequent or out of order. The asequent data problem is presented in a simple recursive information filter form. The information filter equations presented in this paper are applied in a decentralised picture compilation problem. This involves multiple aircraft tracking multiple ground targets and the construction of a single common tactical picture.},

The paper has several components. First they describe multi-vehicle

for up to three agents. They present another technique using Inverse
Dynamic Optimization. The paper also introduces a new control architecture

uses accomodates centralized (like virtual structure), leader-following,
and absolute (like behavioral). They conclude that the architecture
plays a key role in the performance of the formation. The paper also
develops a formation planner that is in charge of moving the formation

a linear programming approach. The equalization is very poor. },

	abstract = {We present Monte Carlo methods for multi-target tracking and data association. The methods are applicable to general nonlinear and non-Gaussian models for the target dynamics and measurement likelihood. We provide efficient solutions to two very pertinent problems: the data association problem that arises due to unlabelled measurements in the presence of clutter, and the curse of dimensionality that arises due to the increased size of the state-space associated with multiple targets. We develop a number of algorithms to achieve this. The first, which we refer to as the Monte Carlo joint probabilistic data association filter (MC-JPDAF), is a generalisation of the strategy proposed in [1] and [2]. As is the case for the JPDAF, the distributions of interest are the marginal filtering distributions for each of the targets, but these are approximated with particles rather than Gaussians. We also develop two extensions to the standard particle filtering methodology for tracking multiple targets. The first, which we refer to as the sequential sampling particle filter (SSPF), samples the individual targets sequentially by utilising a factorisation of the importance weights. The second, which we refer to as the independent partition particle filter (IPPF), assumes the associations to be independent over the individual targets, leading to an efficient component-wise sampling strategy to construct new particles. We evaluate and compare the proposed methods on a challenging synthetic tracking problem.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we use computer vision as a feedback sensor in a control
loop

for landing an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) on a landing pad. The vision

problem we address here is then a special case of the classic ego-motion

estimation problem since all feature points lie on a planar surface
(the landing

pad). We study together the discrete and differential versions of
the ego-motion

estimation, in order to obtain both position and velocity of the UAV
relative to

the landing pad. After briefly reviewing existing algorithm for the
discrete case,

we present, in a unified geometric framework, a new estimation scheme
for

solving the differential case. We further show how the obtained algorithms

enable the vision sensor to be placed in the feedback loop as a state
observer for

landing control. These algorithms are linear, numerically robust,
and

computationally inexpensive hence suitable for real-time implementation.
We

present a thorough performance evaluation of the motion estimation
algorithms

under varying levels of image measurement noise, altitudes of the
camera above

the landing pad, and different camera motions relative to the landing
pad. A

landing controller is then designed for a full dynamic model of the
UAV. Using

geometric nonlinear control theory, the dynamics of the UAV are decoupled

into an inner system and outer system. The proposed control scheme
is then

based on the differential flatness of the outer system. For the overall
closed-loop

system, conditions are provided under which exponential stability
can be

guaranteed. In the closed-loop system, the controller is tightly coupled
with the

vision based state estimation and the only auxiliary sensor are accelerometers

for measuring acceleration of the UAV. Finally, we show through simulation

results that the designed vision-in-the-loop controller generates
stable landing

maneuvers even for large levels of image measurement noise. Experiments
on

a real UAV will be presented in future work.},

The algorithmuses a dynamic occupancy grid to model the target state,which is updated by sensor measurements using a Bayesian filter.Based on the current and predicted target behavior, the path planningalgorithm for a single vehicle (UAV/UGV) is first designed tomaximize the sum of the probability of detection over a finite lookaheadhorizon. The algorithm is then extended to multiple vehiclecollaboration scenarios, where a decentralized planning algorithmrelying on an auction scheme is designed to plan finite look-aheadpaths that maximize the sum of the joint probability of detectionover all vehicles.},

Mini-UAVs further complicate the problem by introducing severe restrictions on the size and weight of electro-optical sensor assemblies. We present a field-tested mini-UAV gimbal mechanism and flightpath generation algorithm as well as a human-UAV interaction scheme in which the operator manually flies the UAV to produce an estimate of the target position, then allows the aircraft to fly itself and control the gimbal while the operator re fines or moves the target position as required. },

Passivity-based control, output feedback, dirty derivative, Comments:
In my oppinion, this is a very substantial paper. The basic idea
is to cascade an Euler-Lagrange system (control) with the plant,
also modelled as an EL system, to obtain a larger EL system. EL systems
are passive systems, and so if you make the controller dissipative,
the closed loop system will be globally asymptotically stable. There
are many advantages, including the fact that only output feedback
is required. Also, there are extensions to input saturation constraints.

efficient solution of motion-planning problems for time-invariant

dynamical control systems with symmetries, such as mobile

robots and autonomous vehicles, under a variety of differential

and algebraic constraints on the state and on the control inputs.

Motion plans are described as the concatenation of a number

of well-defined motion primitives, selected from a finite library.

Rules for the concatenation of primitives are given in the form of

a regular language, defined through a finite-state machine called

a Maneuver Automaton. We analyze the reachability properties

of the language, and present algorithms for the solution of a class

of motion-planning problems. In particular, it is shown that the

solution of steering problems for nonlinear dynamical systems

with symmetries and invariant constraints can be reduced to the

solution of a sequence of kinematic inversion problems. A detailed

example of the application of the proposed approach to motion

planning for a small aerobatic helicopter is presented.},

that the velocity of the system converges exponentially to a scaled

disturbances that push in the direction of the desired momentum do not
adversely affect the performance. Moreover, robustness property also

Before new technologies on board manned or unmanned aircraft are deployed, rigorous analysis using encounter simulations is required to prove system robustness. These simulations rely on models that accurately reflect the geometries and dynamics of aircraft encounters at close range. These types of encounter models have been developed by several organizations since the early 1980s. Lincoln Laboratory's newer encounter models, however, provide a higher-fidelity representation of encounters, are based on substantially more data, leverage a theoretical framework for finding optimal model structures, and reflect recent changes in the airspace. Three categories of encounter model were developed by Lincoln Laboratory. Two of these categories are used for modeling conventional aircraft; one involving encounters with prior air traffic control intervention and one without. The third category of encounter model is for encounters with unconventional aircraft---such as gliders, skydivers, balloons, and airships---that typically do not carry transponders. Together, these encounter models are being used to examine the safety and effectiveness of aircraft collision avoidance systems and as a foundation for algorithms for future manned and unmanned systems.},

This paper describes the development and evaluation of a

vision-based collision detection algorithm suitable for fixed-wing

aerial robotics. The system was evaluated using highly realistic

vision data of the moments leading up to a collision. Based

on the collected data, our detection approaches were able to

detect targets at distances ranging from 400m to about 900m.

These distances (with some assumptions about closing speeds

and aircraft trajectories) translate to an advanced warning of

between 8-10 seconds ahead of impact, which approaches the

12.5 second response time recommended for human pilots. We

make use of the enormous potential of graphic processing units

to achieve processing rates of 30Hz (for images of size 1024-by-

	abstract = { A method is discussed for estimating the state of a linear dynamic system using noisy observations, when the input to the dynamic system and the observation errors are completely unknown except for bounds on their magnitude or energy. The state estimate is actually a set in state space rather than a single vector. The optimum estimate is the smallest calculable set which contains the unknown system state, but it is usually impractical to calculate this set. A recursive algorithm is developed which calculates a time-varying ellipsoid in state space that always contains the system's true state. Unfortunately the algorithm is still unproven in the sense that its performance has not yet been evaluated. The algorithm is closely related in structure but not in performance to the algorithm obtained when the system inputs and observation errors are white Gaussian processes. The algorithm development is motivated by the problem of tracking an evasive target, but the results have wider applications.},

The probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is a recursion that propagates the posterior intensity function-a 1st-order moment-of the random set of multiple targets in time. Like the Bayesian single-target filter, the PHD recursion also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Although sequential Monte Carlo implementations have demonstrated the potential of the PHD filter, so far no closed-form solutions have yet been developed. In this paper, an analytic solution to the PHD recursion is proposed for linear Gaussian target dynamics with Gaussian births.

an overview of the numerical methods, including recent works, usually

implemented to approximate this filter. Comparisons of theses methods

two different nonlinear models are finally presented. The first one
is the

Van der Pol oscillator which is widely used as a benchmark. The second

one is a neuronal population model. This more original model is used
to

simulate EEG activity of the cortex. Experiments showed better stability

used sensor modality for aircraft navigation, researchers
have been motivated to investigate other navigational sensor
modalities because of the desire to operate in GPS denied

as an alternative/collaborative sensor to GPS systems. Cameras
can act as navigational sensors by detecting and tracking feature
points in an image. Current methods have a limited ability to
relate feature points as they enter and leave the camera field of
view (FOV).
A vision-based position and orientation estimation method
for aircraft navigation and control is described. This estimation
method accounts for a limited camera FOV by releasing tracked
features that are about to leave the FOV and tracking new
features. At each time instant that new features are selected for
tracking, the previous pose estimate is updated. The vision-based
estimation scheme can provide input directly to the vehicle
guidance system and autopilot. Simulations are performed
wherein the vision-based pose estimation is integrated with a
nonlinear flight model of an aircraft. Experimental verification

	abstract = {This chapter provides a comprehensive intro- duction in to the simultaneous localization and mapping problem, better known in its abbrevi- ated form as SLAM. SLAM addresses the problem of a robot navigating an unknown environment. While navigating the environment, the robot seeks to acquire a map thereof, and at the same time it wishes to localize itself using its map. The use of SLAM problems can be motivated in two different ways: one might be interested in detailed envi- ronment models, or one might seek to maintain an accurate sense of a mobile robot's location. SLAM serves both of these purposes. We review three major paradigms of algorithms from which a huge number of recently published methods are derived. First comes the traditional approach, which relies on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for representing the robot's best es- timate. The second paradigm draws its intuition from the fact that the SLAM problem can be viewed as a sparse graph of constraints, and it applies nonlinear optimization for recovering the map and the robot's locations. Finally, we survey the particle filter paradigm, which applies nonparametric density estimation and efficient factorization methods to the SLAM problem. This chapter dis- cusses extensions of these basic methods. It elucidates variants of the SLAM problem and proposes a taxonomy for the field. Relevant re- search is referenced extensively, and open research problems are discussed.},

Therefore, a team of UAVs that satisfies the target resource requirement needs to be assigned to a single target, and this team is called a coalition.

	abstract = { Location: Ref DB 2 Keywords: Finite Element, State space reductions,
model reduction, balanced realization Comments: In the dynamics modeling
of a structure, finite element analysis employs reduction techniques,
such as Guyan's reduction, that remove some of the insignificant
physical coordinates, that is, degrees of freedom at a node point.
Despite such reduction, the resultant model is still too large for
control design. This warrents further reduction as is frequently
done in control design by approximating a large dynamical systm with
a fewer number of state variables. A problem, however, arises because
a model usually undergoes, before being reduced, some form of coordinate
transformations that destroy the physical meaning of the states.
To correct such a problem, we developed a method that expresses a
reduced model in terms of a subset of the original states. The proposed
method starts with a dynamic model that is originated and reduced
in finite element analysis. The model is then converted to a state-space
form, and reduced further by the internal balancing method. At this
stage, being in the balanced coordinate system, the states in the
reduced model have no apparent resemblance to those of the original
model. Through another coordinate transformation that is developed
in this paper, however, this reduced model is expressed by a subset
of the original states, so that the states in the reduced model can
be related to the degrees of freedom of the nodes in the original
finite element model. },

have long been advanced relating the Pontryagin maximum principle
and dynamic programming according to the equation

$\backslash$[ (H(t,x{\^{}}*(t),u{\^{}}*(t),p(t)),-p(t)) = $\backslash$grad V(t,x{\^{}}*(t)), $\backslash$]

where (x{\^{}}*,u{\^{}}*) is the optimal control process under consideration,
p(t) is the coextremal, and H is the Hamiltonian. The relationship
has previously been verified under only very restrictive hypotheses.
We prove new results, establishing the relationship, now expressed
in terms of the generalized gradient of V, for a large class of nonsmooth

By this approach, an analytically- derived boundary for well clear can be derived that supports rigorous safety assessment. A preliminary boundary is proposed in both time and distance for the well clear separation standard, and recommendations for future work are made.},

Comments: A method is described for constructing a feedback control
law which remains optimal for a class of systems with unknown parameters
whose values may lie in given regions. The control depends only on
the input and output, and there is no explicit dependence on the
unknown parameters. In contrast to the usual adaptive strategy, there
is no idenification or adjustment period. The optimal control is
generated in a Taylor series form, but truncation of the series results
in a feedback control which is close to optimal for a range of parameter
values. An nth-order truncation of the control results in a (2n+1)th-order
approximation of the optimally adaptive performance index. },

@article{Moses2011,
	abstract = {It is claimed that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) used for civilian/public domain applications will be dominant in the near future. Compared to UAVs used by the military, civilian UAVs are often operated by pilots without formal training, and hence they require increased levels of autonomy and intelligence, especially with regard to reducing threats to public safety. UAV integration into the National Air Space will require that the UAVs support multiple, complementary sense-and-avoid mechanisms, including detection and identification of other UAV-sized targets. Currently, the majority of available sensors are based on infrared detectors, focal plane arrays, optical and ultrasonic rangefinders. These sensors are generally not able to detect or identify other UAV-sized targets and, when detection is possible, considerable computational power may be required for successful identification. By contrast, this paper describes the design of a light weight, X-Band (10.5GHz) radar system for use on a small-scale ({\&}{\#}x003C; 25 kg) rotorcraft. The prototype radar implementation is small enough to be carried by any miniature UAV, and it is capable of differentiating other miniature rotorcraft by their doppler signature. In addition to the overall hardware and software design of the prototype system, a performance analysis of various signature matching algorithms is presented demonstrating the capabilities of the system in a laboratory setting.},

also described. The resulting expression for the error variance is
used to optimize the physical

the desired drogue orbit. A Lyapunov-based controller derived

using backstepping is proposed that enables tracking error of

where the size of the ultimate bound is a function of the

From an initial reading, it appears that the downside is that $\gamma$
may not be close to optimal, and there is a lower bound on how small
you can make $\gamma$ and have the method still work. This lower
bound, may also be much larger than the optimal $\gamma$. It would
be interesting to try this method and compare it with the SGA approach.

switching between clockwise and counter clockwise orbits so that

equal to the velocity of the ground target. The second class of flight
trajectories, called orbital trajectories, consists of orbits and
straight line motions. Longitudinal trajectories are shown to have
advantages when the ground speed of the target is close to the ground

slow targets. As a final result, we show that the optimal switching

Rather, a set of underdetermined task functions are developedto regulate the mean and variance of a set of image features. Regulatingthese task functions inhibits feature points from leaving the camera FOV.An additional task function is used to maintain a high level of motionperceptibility, which ensures that desired feature point velocities can beachieved. These task functions are mapped to camera velocity, which servesas the system input. A proof of stability is presented for tracking three orfewer targets.

UAVs systems have been proposed for a wide range of applications such as mapping, surveillance, search, and tracking operations. The recent availability of low-cost UAVs suggests the use of teams of vehicles to perform sensing tasks. To leverage the capabilities of a team of vehicles, efficient methods of decentralized sensing and cooperative path planning are necessary. The goal of this work is to examine practical control strategies for a team of fixed-wing vehicles performing cooperative sensing. We seek to develop decentralized, autonomous control strategies that can account for a wide variety of sensing missions. Sensing goals are posed from an information theoretic standpoint to design strategies that explicitly minimize uncertainty. This work proposes a tightly coupled approach, in which sensor models and estimation objectives are used online for path planning.},

In contrast to the commonly used filtering techniques, the proposed approach is based on a non-linear optimization for processing incoming measurements from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and any other available sensors into a navigation solution. A factor graph formulation is introduced that allows multi-rate, asyn- chronous, and possibly delayed measurements to be incorporated in a natural way. This method, based on a recently developed incremental smoother, automatically determines the number of states to recompute at each step, effectively acting as an adaptive fixed-lag smoother. This yields an efficient and general framework for information fusion, providing nearly-optimal state estimates. In particular, incoming IMU measurements can be processed in real time regardless to the size of the graph. The proposed method is demonstrated in a simulated environment using IMU, GPS and stereo vision measurements and compared to the optimal solution obtained by a full non-linear batch optimization and to a conventional extended Kalman filter (EKF).},

MILP Comments: This paper describes methods for optimizing the task
allocation problem for a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
with tightly coupled tasks and rigid relative timing constraints.
The overall objective is to minimize the mission completion time
for the fleet, and the task assignment must account for differing
UAV capabilities and no-fly zones. Loitering times are included as
extra degrees of freedom in the problem to help meet the timing constraints.
The overall problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP), which gives the globally optimal solution. An approximate
decomposition solution method is also used to overcome the computational
issues that arise when using MILP for larger problems. The problem
is also posed in a way that can be solved using Tabu search. This
approach is demonstrated to provide good solutions in reasonable
computation times for large problems that are very difficult to solve
using the exact or approximate decomposition methods. },

power electronics and digital processors at reduced costs, there
has been a trend to seek higher performance from electric machine
systems through the design of more sophisticated control systems
software. There exist significant challenges in the search for improved
control system designs however, since (i) the dynamics of most electrc
machine systems exhibit significant nonlinearities, (ii) not all
state variables are necessarily measured, and (iii) the parameters
of the system can vary significantly from their nominal values. In
recent years, a wide range of nonlinear methods from feedback control,
state estimation and parameter identification have emerged, and some
of these results are reviewed and summarized in this article. },

	abstract = {Abstract---Advancing research into autonomous micro aerial

vehicle navigation requires data structures capable of representing

indoor and outdoor 3D environments. The vehicle must

be able to update the map structure in real time using readings

from range-finding sensors when mapping unknown areas; it

must also be able to look up occupancy information from

the map for the purposes of localization and path-planning.

Mapping models that have been used for these tasks include

voxel grids, multi-level surface maps, and octrees. In this paper,

we suggest a new approach to 3D mapping using a multi-volume

occupancy grid, or MVOG. MVOGs explicitly store information

about both obstacles and free space. This allows us to correct

previous potentially erroneous sensor readings by incrementally

fusing in new positive or negative sensor information. In turn,

this enables extracting more reliable probabilistic information

about the occupancy of 3D space. MVOGs outperform existing

probabilistic 3D mapping methods in terms of memory usage,

due to the fact that observations are grouped together into

continuous vertical volumes to save space. We describe the

techniques required for mapping using MVOGs, and analyze

their performance using indoor and outdoor experimental data.},

This paper applies nonlinear H{\_}$\backslash$infty control theory to the attitude

is a linear feedback control. The results are somewhat uninteresting
because the system is guaranteed to have L{\_}2 gain less than $\gamma$
for $\gamma${\textgreater}1. But we are really only interested in the case where
$\gamma${\textless}1. },

involves multiple aerial surveillance UAVs which are required to monitor a ground object

the tracking and distributed time-coordination algorithms. Numerical and real flight test

In the architecture pipeline, video data is processed by each UAS to detect motion in the image frame. The ground based location of the detected motion is estimated using a geolocation algorithm. The subsequent data points are then process by the recently introduced Recursive RANSAC (R-RANSASC) algorithm to produce a set of tracks. These tracks are then communicated over the network and the error in the coordinate frames between vehicles must be estimated. After the tracks have been placed in the same coordinate frame, a track-to-track association algorithm is used to determine which tracks in each camera correspond to tracks in other cameras. Associated tracks are then fused using a distributed information filter. The proposed method is demonstrated on data collected from two multirotors tracking a person walking on the ground.},

We show that the classical gated nearest neighbor approach, which considers each matching between sensor observations and features independently, ignores the fact that measurement prediction errors are correlated. This leads to easily accepting incorrect matchings when clutter or vehicle errors increase. We propose a new measurement of the joint compatibility of a set of pairings that successfully rejects spurious matchings. We show experimentally that this restrictive criterion can be used to efficiently search for the best solution to data association. Unlike the nearest neighbor, this method provides a robust solution in complex situations, such as cluttered environments or when revisiting previously mapped regions},

of animals served as an inspiration to pioneers of human flight,
we don't really understand how they work. In this study, we employ
the concept of four-bar linkage to design a flapping mechanism which
simulates a flapping motion of a bird. Wind tunnel tests were performed
to measure the lift and thrust of the mechanical membrane flapping
wing under different frequency, speed, and angle of attack. It is
observed that the flexibility of the wing structure will affect the
thrust and lift force due to its deformation at high flapping frequency.
The lift force will increase with the increase of the flapping frequency
under the corresponding flying speed. For the same flapping frequency,
the flying speed can be increased by decrease of the angle of attack
with the trade of loosing some lift force. An angle of attack is
necessary in a simple flapping motion in order to derive a lift force.
The flapping motion generates the thrust to acquire the flying speed.
The flying speed and angle of attack combine to generate the lift
force for flying.},

vector, arc formations, distributed control, behavioral approach
Comments: This paper describes a distributed approach to robot formation
control. The robots are assumed to be holonomic. Every robot has
a formation control vector. This vector is used to coordinate amoung
the robots. The particular application described in this paper is
that of forming an arc between two beacons to obstruct passage by
a criminal trying to escape. The robots at the end of the line, move
to the beacons, the robots in the middle of the line use the formation
vector to move the midpoint between two other robots. It seems that
this paper fits well into our coordination architecture. The specific
relationship should be explored. },

strapdown inertial measurement unit (IMU). The unit comprises

four ceramic vibrating structure gyroscopes and four QLC 400 accelerometers

configured on a truncated tetrahedron design. This

design allows for the optimal configuration of the eight sensors,

which in turn provides for a theoretical 33{\%} increase in information.

The redundant sensor configuration also allows for fault detection,

which is required for many autonomous applications. This initiative

is a precursor for future developments with more sensors to provide

fault isolation. The paper will also present a navigation system implementing

the redundant IMU with the global positioning system.

Results are provided of this navigation system being implemented in

Use is made of a finite control horizon in conjunction with a terminal inequality constraint and a predicted cost that includes a terminal penalty term. The optimization procedure is based on predictions made by linearized incremental models at points of a given seed trajectory and the effects of linearization error are taken into account to give a bound on the predicted tracking error. The algorithm is posed in the form of an LP and the proper selection of the terminal penalty term of the predicted cost guarantees the asymptotic stability.

@article{Tian2008,
	abstract = {Track-to-track association (T2TA) is very important in distributed tracking systems. When the fusion center receives multiple tracks from a local tracker, T2TA needs to be performed before track-to-track fusion (T2TF). The problem of T2TA, similar to measurement-to-track association, can be formulated and solved as an assignment problem, whose costs are based on the likelihood of assigning a local track to a central track, namely, the likelihood of the hypothesis H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}: the two tracks originated from the same target. Thus the basic hypothesis test of whether two tracks are for the same target is very important for T2TA. Compared to the measurement-to-track association, T2TA has two features: i) The local track is correlated with the central track that has the same origin with it, due to the common process noise of the target. ii) Multiple frames of data are available from both the tracks. Thus, two issues are of concern for the T2TA test, namely, the derivation of the exact test statistic needs to take into account the crosscorrelation between the tracks; and how should multiple frames of data from the tracks be utilized. In this paper, the exact algorithm for calculating the test statistic for T2TA using multiple frames of data is derived. To keep the complexity of the algorithm under control, a limit is set for the number of the frames of data used in the test, which leads to a sliding window test for the problem of T2TA. By accounting for the cross-correlations between tracks for the same target and the cross-correlations across time of the terms entering into the test statistics, the proposed test for T2TA yields false rejections of H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} that match the theoretical values. Then the sliding window test is compared with the single time test. It is shown that the intuitive belief ldquothe longer the window, the more the power of the testrdquo is not necessarily correct. Thus, caution should be used when using multiple frames of data from the tracks -
-
to improve the power of the test.},

There is great interest in MAV/SUAV use but limited simulation work has been dedicated specifically to issues associated with very small vehicles that cruise at slow speeds near the ground. Development of satisfactory six-degree-of-freedom models of an MAV and SUAV were the first tasks to be tackled, along with the integration of these models into the MultiUAV 2.0 simulation environment. The second task was to model and integrate wind data for complex urban flows into this simulation. This involved creating modules to interface the simulation with CFD results and data obtained through urban airflow experiments. An urban environment for the MAV to fly through was constructed using the geometry of a likely COUNTER flight test location. These basic elements coupled with future cooperative control task assignment and path planning algorithms complete this engineering simulation.},

@article{KamalBappyFarrell16,
	abstract = {Abstract---Distributed algorithms have recently gained immense popularity. With regards to computer vision applications, distributed
multi-target tracking in a camera network is a fundamental problem. The goal is for all cameras to have accurate state estimates for all
targets. Distributed estimation algorithms work by exchanging information between sensors that are communication neighbors.
Vision-based distributed multi-target state estimation has at least two characteristics that distinguishes it from other applications. First,
cameras are directional sensors and often neighboring sensors may not be sensing the same targets, i.e., they are naive with respect to
that target. Second, in the presence of clutter and multiple targets, each camera must solve a data association problem. This paper
presents an information-weighted, consensus-based, distributed multi-target tracking algorithm referred to as the Multi-target
Information Consensus (MTIC) algorithm that is designed to address both the naivety and the data association problems. It converges
to the centralized minimum mean square error estimate. The proposed MTIC algorithm and its extensions to non-linear camera models,
termed as the Extended MTIC (EMTIC), are robust to false measurements and limited resources like power, bandwidth and the realtime
operational requirements. Simulation and experimental analysis are provided to support the theoretical results.},

	abstract = {Distributed motion planning of multiple agents raises

fundamental and novel problems in control theory and robotics.

In particular, in applications such as coverage by mobile sensor

networks or multiple target tracking, a great new challenge is the

development of motion planning algorithms that dynamically assign

targets or destinations to multiple homogeneous agents, not

relying on any a priori assignment of agents to destinations. In

this paper, we address this challenge using two novel ideas. First,

distributed multidestination potential fields are developed that are

able to drive every agent to any available destination. Second, nearest

neighbor coordination protocols are developed ensuring that

distinct agents are assigned to distinct destinations. Integration

of the overall system results in a distributed, multiagent, hybrid

system for which we show that the mutual exclusion property of

the final assignment is guaranteed for almost all initial conditions.

Furthermore, we showthat our dynamic assignment algorithm will

converge after exploring at most a polynomial number of assignments,

dramatically reducing the combinatorial nature of purely

discrete assignment problems. Our scalable approach is illustrated

with nontrivial computer simulations.},

	abstract = {The computationally efficient search for robust feasible paths for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of uncertainty is a challenging and interesting area of research. In uncertain environments, a ``conservative'' planner may be required but then there may be no feasible solution. In this paper, we use a chance constraint to limit the probability of constraint violation and extend this framework to handle uncertain dynamic obstacles. The approach requires the satisfaction of probabilistic constraints at each time step in order to guarantee probabilistic feasibility. The rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm, which enjoys the computational benefits of a sampling-based algorithm, is used to develop a real-time probabilistically robust path planner. It incorporates the chance constraint framework to account for uncertainty within the formulation and includes a number of heuristics to improve the algorithm's performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be used for efficient identification and execution of probabilistically safe paths in real-time.},

A derivation of a nonlinear observer on SE(3) is presented, using a Lyapunov function conveniently expressed as a function of the difference between the estimated and the measured landmark coordinates. The resulting feedback laws are explicit functions of the landmark measurements and velocity readings, exploiting the sensor information directly in the observer. The proposed observer yields almost global asymptotic stabilization of the position and attitude errors and exponential convergence in any closed ball inside the region of attraction. Also, it is shown that the asymptotic convergence of the estimation error trajectories is shaped by the landmark geometry and observer design parameters. The problem of non-ideal velocity readings is also considered, and the observer is augmented to compensate for bias in the angular and linear velocity measurements. The resulting position, attitude, and bias estimation errors are shown to converge exponentially fast to the desired equilibrium points, for bounded initial estimation errors. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the stability and convergence properties of the observer. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{MesbahiHadaegh00,
	abstract = { Location: Ref DB 12 shelf Keywords: formation flying spacecraft interferometry
leader following hybrid control switching linear matrix inequalities
LMI Comments: This paper presents some clever results for multiple
spacecraft formation flying. The main contributions of the paper
are as follows: - A clean mathematical notation for leader-following,
including a nice application of graph theoretic results, - New control
laws for formation flying control based in LMI's, - A stability analysis
for leader reassignment, - New hybrid control laws for formation
control that avoid control saturation.

The notation introduced by the author is very clean and will probably
set a standard for future papers in formation control.

The new control laws based on LMI's are only a small contribution,
and do not add much to the understanding of formation control.

Leader reassignment is a big issue in formation control. If a leader-following
architecture is used, then failure of the leader could compromise
the entire mission. Robustness demands the possibility of leader
reassignment. The discussion in the current paper is good, however
I wonder about the usefulness of the example presented in Figure 6,
where the follower is circling the leader. Suppose that we desire
spacecraft {{\#}}2 to circle spacecraft {{\#}}1 independent of who is currently
assigned as the leader. It is unclear whether the method proposed
by the authors is applicable to this case.

One of the major disadvantages to leader-following control is that
the acceleration of the leader is used in the control law of the
followers. As a result, acceleration of the leader may cause saturation
of the followers controls. This paper presents a nice solution to
this problem, based on switching and LMI's. While stability of the
overall hybrid scheme is addressed, it is unclear how the resulting
scheme affects the ability of the followers to maintain formation.
Intuitively, the switching mechanism must reduce the gain of the
followers control, which will reduce the achievable performance of
the controls. One criticism of the presentation is that the authors
do not offer any intuition about the action of the control. I would
suggest adding a few (non-mathematical) digressions to give the reader
a feel for how the proposed control laws address the saturation problem.

flow region behind a backward-facing step by means of a small flapping
foil, and the reduction or suppression of flow separation behind
blunt or cusped airfoil trailing edges by flapping a small foil located
in the wake flow region. These studies were followed by systematic
investigations of the aerodynamic characteristics of single flapping
airfoils and airfoil combinations. These unsteady flows were described
using flow visualization, laser-Doppler velocimetry in addition to
panel and Navier--Stokes computations. It is then shown how this
flapping-wing database was used to conceive, design and develop a
micro air vehicle which has a fixed wing for lift and two flapping
wings for thrust generation. While animal flight is characterized
by a coupled force generation, the present design appears to separate
lift and thrust. However, in fact, the performance of one surface

This is the most practical configuration for AT2TF with time delays, since communication delays make full information feedback very complicated. The first algorithm is the optimal memoryless AT2TF under the Linear Gaussian (LG) assumption (denoted as AT2TFpfwoMopt), which is also the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) fuser without the Gaussian assumption. The second is the Information Matrix Fusion for asynchronous T2TF (denoted as AT2TFpfIMF), which is an extension of the synchronous IMF algorithm. Both algorithms are novel. The third is an approximate AT2TF algorithm proposed by Novoselsky (denoted as AT2TFpfAppr). Among the three algorithms, only the first one theoretically guarantees the consistency of the fuser. The latter two algorithms involve certain degrees of heuristics. Simulation results show that, for the scenarios considered, AT2TFpfIMF is also consistent and has similar level of tracking accuracy as AT2TFpfwoMopt. On the other hand, AT2TFpfAppr has consistency problems. Further more, due to the simplicity of AT2TFpfIMF compared to AT2TFpfwoMopt, it is an appealing candidate for practical applications.},

Here, each MS is modelled by a rigid body with fixed center of mass.
First, various schemes for generating the desired formation patterns
are discussed. The explicit control laws for formation keeping and
relative attidue alignment based on nearest neighbor-tracking are
derived. The necessary data which must be communicated between the
MS to achieve effective control are examined. The time-domain behavior
of the feedback-controlled MS formation for typical low-Earth orbits
is studied both analyticallly and via computer simulation. The paper
concludes with a discussion of the implementation of the derived
control laws, and the integration of the MS formation coordination
and control system with a proposed inter-spacecraft communication/computing
network.

This paper derives control laws for micro-satellites flying in tightly
controlled formations. Position and attitude control laws are derived
to maintain relative position and attitude control laws. The controls

that the feedback control laws for the kinematics minimize a quadratic

For the complete system, we consturct a family of exponentially stabilizing

This project was completed for a class in complex adaptive systems

Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft has the merits of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. Tail-sitting is the simplest way for the VTOL maneuver since it does not need extra actuators. However, conventional hovering control for a tail-sitter UAV is not robust enough against large disturbance such as a blast of wind, a bird strike, and so on. It is experimentally observed that the conventional quaternion feedback hovering control often fails to keep stability when the control compensates large attitude errors. This paper proposes a novel hovering control strategy for a tail-sitter VTOL UAV that increases stability against large disturbance. In order to verify the proposed hovering control strategy, simulations and experiments on hovering of the UAV are performed giving large attitude errors. The results show that the proposed control strategy successfully compensates initial large attitude errors keeping stability, while the conventional quaternion feedback controller fails. 2010 IEEE.},

@article{BreugalMorgansenDickinson14,
	abstract = {Vision is arguably the most widely used sensor for position and velocity estimation in animals, and it is increasingly used in robotic systems as well. Many animals use stereopsis and object recognition in order to make a true estimate of distance. For a tiny insect such as a fruit fly or honeybee, however, these methods fall short. Instead, an insect must rely on calculations of optic flow, which can provide a measure of the ratio of velocity to distance, but not either parameter independently. Nevertheless, flies and other insects are adept at landing on a variety of substrates, a behavior that inherently requires some form of distance estimation in order to trigger distance-appropriate motor actions such as deceleration or leg extension. Previous studies have shown that these behaviors are indeed under visual control, raising the question: how does an insect estimate distance solely using optic flow? In this paper we use a nonlinear control theoretic approach to propose a solution for this problem. Our algorithm takes advantage of visually controlled landing trajectories that have been observed in flies and honeybees. Finally, we implement our algorithm, which we term dynamic peering, using a camera mounted to a linear stage to demonstrate its real-world feasibility.},

	abstract = {AbstractOver the past few decades, the computational
power has been increasing rapidly. With advances of the
parallel computation architectures it provides new opportunities
for solving the optimal estimation problem in realtime.
In addition, sensor miniaturization technology enables us
to acquire multiple measurements at low cost. Kolmogorov's
forward equation is the governing equation of the nonlinear
estimation problem. The nonlinear projection lter presented
in the late 90's is an almost exact solution of the nonlinear
estimation problem, which solves the governing equation using
Galerkin's method. The lter requires high-dimensional
integration in several steps and the complexity of the lter
increases exponentially with the dimension of systems. The
current parallel computation speed with the usage of many
sensors at the same time make it feasible to implement the
lter efciently for practical systems with some mild dimension
sizes. On-line or off-line multi-dimensional integration is to
be performed over the parallel computation using the Monte-
Carlo integration method and random samples for the state
update are obtained more efciently based on the multiple
sensor measurements. A few simplications of the lter are
also derived to reduce the computational cost. The methods
are veried with two numerical examples and one experimental
example.},

We propose a distributed algorithm with which each node can estimate its offset/skew from these noisy relative measurements by communicating only with its neighbors. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement. We model the change in the communication network due to the moving nodes as a Markov chain whose state space is the set of graphs that can occur. Using tools from Markov Jump Linear Systems, we provide a sufficient condition for the mean square convergence of the estimation error. A conjecture on mean square convergence under weaker conditions is discussed. Monte Carlo simulations are provided that corroborate the predictions and justify the conjecture.},

	abstract = {The ability of uninhabited aerial vehicles to perform drastic maneuvers
enables them to benefit from wind profiles

that may be unfavorable to inhabited aircraft. This paper examines
optimal uninhabited aerial vehicle flights that

can extract energy from downdrafts for enhancing endurance. Uninhabited
aerial vehicle motions are described by a

point-mass dynamic model. A downdraft wind field is modeled by a pair
of three-dimensional vortex rings placed

symmetrically with respect to the ground. Fundamental dimensionless
parameters that affect uninhabited aerial

vehicle behaviors in a downdraft are identified through the normalization
of the equations and wind expressions.

Uninhabited aerial vehicle flight through a downdraft is formulated
as a nonlinear optimal control problem that

minimizes the average thrust or power per unit time. Vehicle performance
and operational limits are enforced

through boundary conditions and path constraints. These optimal control
problems are converted into parameter

optimization problems with a collocation method and solved numerically
using the sparse parameter optimization

software SNOPT. Numerical solutions systematically obtained for a
range of dimensionless parameters reveal four

basic patterns of optimal uninhabited aerial vehicle flights through
a downdraft in the vertical plane. Results

demonstrate that traditional definitions of favorable winds may need
to be revised for uninhabited aerial vehicles.},

	abstract = {Abstract--- In this paper, a hierarchical

framework for task assignment and path

planning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles

(UAVs) in a dynamic environment is presented.

For multi-agent scenarios in dynamic

environments, a candidate algorithm should be

able to replan for a new path to perform the

updated tasks without any collision with

obstacles or other agents during the mission. In

this paper, we propose an intersection-based

algorithm for path generation and a negotiation

-based algorithm for task assignment since

these algorithms are able to generate admissible

paths at a smaller computing cost. The path

planning algorithm is also augmented with a

potential field-based trajectory replanner,

which solves for a detouring trajectory around

other agents or pop-up obstacles. For validation,

test scenarios for multiple UAVs to perform

cooperative missions in dynamic environments

are considered. The proposed algorithms are

implemented on a fixed-wing UAVs testbed in

outdoor environment and showed satisfactory

performance to accomplish the mission in the

presence of static and pop-up obstacles and

other agents.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of verifying motion plans for aerial robots in uncertain and partially-known environments. Thereby, the initial state of the robot is uncertain due to errors from the state estimation and the motion is uncertain due to wind disturbances and control errors caused by sensor noise. Since the environment is perceived at runtime, the verification of partial motion plans must be performed online (i.e. during operation) to ensure safety within the planning horizon and beyond. This is achieved by efficiently generating robust control invariant sets based on so-called loiter circles, where the position of the aerial robot follows a circular pattern. Verification of aerial robots is challenging due to the nonlinearity of their dynamics, the high dimensionality of their state space, and their potentially high velocities. We use novel techniques from reachability analysis to overcome those challenges. In order to ensure that the robot never finds itself in a situation for which no safe maneuver exists, we provide a technique that ensures safety of aerial robots beyond the planning horizon. Our method is applicable to all kinds of robotic systems that follow reference trajectories, such as bipedal robotic walking, robotic manipulators, automated vehicles, and the like. We evaluate our method by simulations of high speed helicopter flights.},

in more detail than usual, so the reader can experiment (and add
to the code) knowing the underlying principles. We find the node
locations by solving for equilibrium in a truss structure (using
piecewise linear force-displacement relations) and we reset the topology
by the Delaunay algorithm. The geometry is described implicitly by
its distance function. In addition to being much shorter and simpler
than other meshing techniques, our algorithm typically produces meshes
of very high quality. We discuss ways to improve the robustness and
the performance, but our aim here is simplicity. Readers can download

the closed loop system will be globally asymptotically stable. There

	abstract = {Abstract Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to carry
resources

in support of search and prosecute operations. Often to completely
prosecute a

target, UAVs may have to simultaneously attack the target with various
resources

with different capacities. However, the UAVs are capable of carrying
only limited

resources in small quantities, hence, a group of UAVs (coalition)
needs to be assigned

that satisfies the target resource requirement. The assigned coalition
must be

such that it minimizes the target prosecution delay and the size of
the coalition. The

problem of forming coalitions is computationally intensive due to
the combinatorial

nature of the problem, but for real-time applications computationally
cheap solutions

are required. In this paper, we propose decentralized sub-optimal
(polynomial time)

and decentralized optimal coalition formation algorithms that generate
coalitions for

a single target with low computational complexity. We compare the
performance

of the proposed algorithms to that of a global optimal solution for
which we

need to solve a centralized combinatorial optimization problem. This
problem is

computationally intensive because the solution has to (a) provide
a coalition for

each target, (b) design a sequence in which targets need to be prosecuted,
and (c)

take into account reduction of UAV resources with usage. To solve
this problem

we use the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. Through simulations,
we

study the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of mission
performance,

complexity of the algorithms and the time taken to form the coalition.
The simulation

results show that the solution provided by the proposed algorithms
is close to the

global optimal solution and requires far less computational resources.},

tracking a group of ground static targets in an
urban area using xed wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
In this scenario, UAVs are equipped with sensors that are
subject to the constraints of urban area occlusions. Information
regarding the line of sight (LOS) occlusions in the urban
area is assumed available. Each UAV, considering the dynamic
constrains arising from the xed wing, is modeled as a Dubins
car. The motion planning of searching the shortest path for
UAVs, namely Dubins path, is a NP hard problem. We propose
an algorithm, which can provide sub-optimal Dubins path,
hence can bring a closed-loop path for UAVs to continuously
track the group of static targets and minimize the time of loss
track. The proposed algorithm is validated through simulations
on a visual database that is based on the CBD in Singapore.},

	abstract = {An adaptive position-tracking control scheme is proposed for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) for a set of bounded external disturbances. The control design is achieved in three main steps. The first step is devoted to the design of an a priori bounded linear acceleration driving the translational dynamics toward the desired trajectory. In the second step, we extract the required a priori bounded thrust and the desired attitude, in terms of unit quaternion, from the desired acceleration derived in the first step. In the last step, we design the required torque for the rotational dynamics, allowing the system{{\&}}{{\#}}x2019;s attitude to be driven toward the desired attitude obtained at the second step. Two control laws for the system control torque are rigorously designed. The first control law ensures that the position-tracking objective is satisfied for any initial conditions, whereas the second ensures that the tracking objective is satisfied for a set of initial conditions, which is dependant on the control gains. The latter case is included, since it is less complicated than the former control law and may be advantageous from a practical point of view. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

	abstract = { Numerous applications require aerial surveillance. Civilian applications
include monitoring forest fires, oil fields, and pipelines and tracking
wildlife. Applications to homeland security include border patrol
and monitoring the perimeter of nuclear power plants. Military applications
are numerous. The current approach to these applications is to use
a single manned vehicle for surveillance. However, manned vehicles
are typically large and expensive. In addition, hazardous environments
and operator fatigue can potentially threaten the life of the pilot.
Therefore, there is a critical need for automating aerial surveillance
using unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). This paper gives an overview
of a cooperative control strategy for aerial surveillance that has
been successfully flight tested on small (48-in wingspan) UAVs. Our
approach to cooperative control problems can be summarized in four
steps: 1) the definition of a cooperation constraint and cooperation
objective; 2) the definition of a coordination variable as the minimal
amount of information needed to effect cooperation; 3) the design
of a centralized cooperation strategy; and 4) the use of consensus
schemes to transform the centralized strategy into a decentralized
algorithm. The effectiveness of the solution will be shown using
both highfidelity simulation and actual flight tests. },

A wide variety of algorithms developed in the artificial intelligence, statistics, signal processing, and digital communications communities can be derived as specific instances of this general algorithm, including Pearl's belief propagation and belief revision algorithms, the fast Fourier transform, the Viterbi algorithm, the forward/backward algorithm, and the iterative turbo decoding algorithm. 1 Introduction A factor graph is a bipartite graph that expresses how a global function of several variables factors into a product of local functions.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a vision-based three-tiered path planning and collision avoidance scheme for small and miniature air vehicles (MAVs), which consists of global, local, and reactive path planners. The global path planner generates inertial paths to the goal configuration based on a known world map that may not necessarily be up-to-date. The local path planner builds maps in the local-level frame of the MAV based on vision data and plans paths to manoeuvre around obstacles with time-to-collision horizon around 3--10 s. The reactive path planner reacts to visually sensed obstacles with time-to-collision horizon less than 3 s by pushing the images of the obstacles to the edges of the image plane, thus avoiding obstacles. A strategy that effectively combines the three path planners is designed to globally guide the MAV to the goal configuration while locally avoiding obstacles. Simulation results show the scheme is successful in solving path planning and obstacle avoidance problems for fixed-wing MAVs in urban terrain.},

@article{MoaseManzieBrear10,
	abstract = {Abstract---In practice, the convergence rate and stability of perturbation
based extremum-seeking schemes can be very sensitive to the curvature
of the plant map. An example of this can be seen in the use of extremum-seeking
to reduce the amplitude of thermoacoustic oscillations in premixed,
gas-turbine combustors. This sensitivity to the plant map curvature
arises from the use of a gradient descent adaptation algorithm. Such
extremum-seeking schemes may need to be conservatively tuned in order
to maintain stability over a wide range of operating conditions,
resulting in slower optimization than could be achieved for a fixed
operating condition. This can severely reduce the effectiveness of
perturbation based extremum-seeking schemes in some applications.
In this paper, a sinusoidally perturbed extremum-seeking scheme using
a Newton-like step is developed. Non-local stability results for
the scheme are formulated using a Lyapunov analysis. A local analysis
of the scheme is given to investigate the influence of plant dynamics
and to show that the local rate of convergence is independent of
the plant map curvature. The benefit of this plant map curvature
independence is then experimentally demonstrated in minimizing the
thermoacoustic oscillations in a model premixed combustor.},

The algorithm is validated on real flights that compare the estimated data against that obtained by the inertial measurement unit IMU, showing that the proposed method robustly estimates the helicopter's 3D position with respect to a reference landmark, with a high quality on the position and orientation estimation when the aircraft is flying at low altitudes, a situation in which the GPS information is often inaccurate.

Our cost function weights force inputs, area covered and motor efficiency to create an optimal trajectory. This trajectory is constrained to follow a coverage path described in the literature. The path is modified based on the cost function by replacing turn-in-place maneuvers by moving turns. Tradeoffs are presented for three cases: (1) drive motor efficiency is not considered, (2) the motors are most efficient at the maximum velocity, and (3) the motors are most efficient below the maximum velocity.

are treated in a transformation framework which allows the generalization

the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations to describe the motion of a satellite
on a circular earth orbit. The formation is modeled using a digraph,
and the thrusts at prescribed times (like perigee and apogee) result
in a discrete time model. An LQ regulator is derived to maintain
the formation. Simulations for low-earth orbits are shown. The along-track

obstacle edges instead. Using an image segmentation technique, edges
are detected as line segments. Subsequently, these edges are modeled
in a 3D space from the measured line segments using known camera

A consensus-based

distributed estimator is applied to estimate the motion of the target.
To compensate for

the uncertainties in the dynamics and prevent them from propagating
into the commu-

nication network, a cascaded control structure is proposed, which
uses the L1 adaptive

controller to drive the real uncertain system to an ideal closed-loop
system obtained from

an existing

ocking algorithm. Since the communication graph is induced by the
position

of the real agents, we cannot exactly implement the ideal

ocking algorithm, which leads to

coupling between the communication topology and the system dynamics.
The guaranteed

transient performance bounds of the L1 adaptive controller are essential
towards resolving

this coupling issue. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the
capability of the pro-

posed algorithms to recover the desired

ocking behavior. The proposed algorithms are

implemented on an indoor multi-robot platform.},

We assume that the UAV is equipped with an autopilot which reduces the twelve degree-of-freedom (DOF) model to a six DOF model with altitude, heading, and velocity command inputs. In this paper we restrict our attention to planar motion. One of the novel features of our approach is that we explicitly account for heading and velocity input constraints. For a fixed wing UAV, the velocity is constrained to lie between two positive constants, and therefore presents particular challenges for the control design. We propose a control Lyapunov function (CLF) approach. We first introduce a CLF for the input constrained case, and then construct the set of all constrained inputs that render the CLF negative. The control input is then selected from this feasible set. The proposed approach is then applied to a simulation scenario, where a UAV is assigned to transition through several targets in the presence of multiple dynamic threats.},

feedback control scheme for an inertially stabilized
double-gimbal airborne camera platform combined with a computer

decoupled controller structure with measurements of the camera

can also compensate for the apparent translation between
the camera and the observed object, but then the velocity of this
mutual translation must be measured or estimated. Even though
the proposed controller is more robust against longer sampling
periods of the computer-vision system then the decoupled controller,
a sketch of a simple compensation of this delay is also
given. Numerical simulations are accompanied by laboratory

tracking control scheme in conjunction with a robust deterministic
estimator that constructs state esti- mates for feedback. These control
and the estimation schemes use the natural and globally unique representation
of rigid body attitude provided by rotation matrices. Attitude and
angular velocity state estimates are constructed from discrete (possibly
multi-rate) mea- surements and a deterministic filtering scheme.
Computational implementation of this estimator-based tracking scheme
is carried out with a Lie group variational integrator, which preserves
the rotation matrix structure without need for reprojection. Numerical
simulation results obtained using this integrator show the robust
and almost global track- ing properties of this scheme. We also compare
the performance of this attitude tracking control scheme with a quaternion
observer-based feedback attitude tracking control scheme that has
appeared in recent literature. Numerical simulation results are obtained
for track- ing an oscillating angular velocity spin maneuver with
both the attitude tracking schemes for a satellite in circular Earth
orbit. These results demonstrate the advantages of our scheme in
attitude tracking of continuous rotational motions.},

a set of hypotheses between time steps. In this technical note we

@conference{IngersollNiedfeldtBeard15,
	abstract = {Abstract---In this paper, we explore the concept of a trackersensor
feedback loop, i.e., how tracker output can inform
sensor processing, and investigate whether it can improve
multiple target tracking performance and enable stationary
object detection in video. Our implementation of the trackersensor
feedback loop is based on the Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) foreground detector. We modify the standard GMM
algorithm by measuring target extent directly from the foreground
mask and by zeroing out the background update rate of
pixels associated with valid tracks. Our tracker-sensor feedback
loop is incorporated into the Recursive-RANSAC framework.
Recursive-RANSAC, a novel multiple target tracker, is enhanced
with the inclusion of the probabilistic data association filter and
nearly constant jerk motion model. We apply our algorithm to
several pseudo-aerial videos that are similar to what might be
captured from a UAV platform. The multiple object tracking
precision and accuracy (MOTP and MOTA) and optimal
sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) metrics are used to measure
tracking performance. Tracker-sensor feedback is shown to
produce a significant improvement in the number of missed
detections, false positives, and track label switches. In terms of
stationary object detection, we demonstrate our method's ability
to indefinitely detect parking cars and abandoned luggage (from
the PETS 2006 dataset) despite frequent occlusions and other
detection challenges.},

The estimated distribution is compared to a previously generated

the predicted uncertainty in the localization. This approach can
be used to generate a sensor uncertainty field for use by the robot's

Comments: Theoretical procedures are developed for camparing the
performance of arbitrarily selected admissible feedback controls
amoung themselves with the optimal solution of a nonlinear optimal
stochastic control problem. Iterative design schemes are proposed
for successively improving the performance of a controller until
a satisfactory design is achieved. Specifically, the exact design
procedure is based on the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation
of the cost function of nonlinear stochastic systems, and teh approximate
design procedure for the infinite-time nonlinear stochastic regulator
problem, is developed by using the upper and lower bounds of the
cost functions. Stability of this problem is also considered. For
a given controller, both the upper and lower bounds to its cost function
can be obtained by solving a partial differential inequality. These
bounds, constructed without actually knowing the optimal controller,
are used as measure to evaluate the acceptability of suboptimal controllers.
These results establish an approximation theory of optimal stochastic
control and provide a practical procedure for selecting effective
practical controls for nonlinear stochastic systems. An Entropy reformulation
of the Generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is also presented.

Path planning and obstacle avoidance for MAVs involve planning a feasible path from an initial state to a goal state while avoiding obstacles in the environment. This paper presents a vision-based local multi-resolution mapping and path planning technique for MAVs using a forward-looking onboard camera. A depth map, which represents the time-to-collision (TTC) and bearing information of the obstacles, is obtained by computer vision algorithms. To account for measurement uncertainties introduced by the camera, a multi-resolution map in the body frame of the MAV is created in polar coordinates. Using the depth map, the locations of the obstacles are determined in the multi-resolution map. Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to find a collision-free path in the body frame. The simulation and flight test results show that the proposed technique is successful in solving path planning and multiple obstacles avoidance problems for MAVs.},

formation flying UAVs Dijkstra's algorithm fault reconfiguration
communication leader-following behavioral scheme (kinda) distributed
Comments: This paper discusses close formation flight for multiple
UAV's, and possibly manned vehicles. The main focus of the paper
is on reconfiguring the communication channels between aircraft.
The dynamics assumed for the aircraft are linearized lateral and
longitudinal dynamics about trim conditions. An autopilot is designed
using LQR techniques. Similar to our current approach, the inputs
to the autopilot are velocity, altitude and heading commands. The
formation controller is a leader following scheme that uses LQ controllers
to track the trajectory of the leader. The leader following scheme
can also be adjusted slightly to accommadate the relative position
of other aircraft. The communication channels are configured using
Dijkstra's algorithm to choose optimal, and suboptimal backup, links.
Three types of communcation faults are discussed: Aircraft loss,
transmitter failure, and receiver failure. Ad hoc, but deterministic
(i.e., pre-programmed) schemes are persented deal with each of these
failures. While distributed, the resolution to these faults does
not constitute coordinated behavior. },

	abstract = {Abstract---This paper introduces a method of automatic
sensor bias calculation for angle only sensor models in a target
tracking scenario. It is assumed that separate Kalman filters are
employed by each sensor and that no measurements of known
landmarks are available. Accurate bias estimation is achieved
through the use of pseudo measurements of slant range from
each sensor to the target and pseudo measurements of each
sensor's bias. The covariance intersection (CI) algorithm is
used to produce a pseudo measurement of slant range. This
pseudo measurement of range allows pseudo measurements of
sensor bias to be calculated based on each sensor's residuals and
Kalman gains. Substantially improved tracking performance
is demonstrated when estimating and accounting for constant
biases on each sensor.},

The comparison is based on experimental results and the cross track error measurements as well as the servo command signals are considered in the analysis. Both the guidance schemes are applied to the underactuated LAUV vehicle in the same environmental conditions with the same speed and heading controllers. The comparison separates between transient and steady-state behaviour, with focus on the latter. In particular, the cross-track error transfer functions for small time varying disturbances are derived for the two guidance schemes at equilibrium and similarities are found with the experimental results. The analysis concludes good path following performance for both the VF and the ILOS guidance laws, with the VF controller performing slightly better.

	abstract = { Motivated by navigation and tracking applications within sensor networks, we consider the problem of performing Kalman filtering with intermittent observations. When data travel along unreliable communication channels in a large, wireless, multihop sensor network, the effect of communication delays and loss of information in the control loop cannot be neglected. We address this problem starting from the discrete Kalman filtering formulation, and modeling the arrival of the observation as a random process. We study the statistical convergence properties of the estimation error covariance, showing the existence of a critical value for the arrival rate of the observations, beyond which a transition to an unbounded state error covariance occurs. We also give upper and lower bounds on this expected state error covariance.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

Given a set up UAVs, a set of no-go regions, and a set of targets,
the paper presents an approach based on mixed-integer linear programming,
that assigns UAVs to sequences of threats. The approach is very similar
to ours in that it uses straight-line path segments to do the task
assignment problem, and then tasks each UAV to plan its own detailed
paths. The approach can handle certain timing constraints such as:
target 1 must be visited before target 5, but doesn't seem be able
to handle timing constraints like simultaneous arrival. The algorithms
are combinatorial in nature and appear to be computationally expensive
even for small problems, however the paper does not mention computations
at all. Detailed trajectory generation is not covered. },

	abstract = {Vertical or short takeoff and landing aircraft can increase passenger throughput at major urban airports via the use of vertiports or stub runways. The concept of simultaneous noninterfering operations has been proposed to reduce traffic delays by creating approach and departure corridors that do not intersect existing fixed-wing routes. This paper introduces an optimization technique fur segmented three-dimensional simultaneous noninterfering trajectory design based on an incremental search strategy that combines a k-ary tree with Dijkstra's algorithm. Existing fixed-wing traffic corridors are modeled as impenetrable obstacles. The objective function is based on a validated AH-1 rotorcraft noise model as well as terminal area population density data. Flight envelope limits are represented as search-space constraints. Candidate final approach trajectories for Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) Airport are presented, illustrating the effects of population density, entry region, and varied number of trajectory segments on the optimal result. The modeling and optimization technique presented in this paper will provide airport and airspace designers with a host of alterative trajectory options for analysis of potential landing sites, associated traffic procedures, and entry options, as shown by the presented BWI case study.},

Duality theorem, Optimal estimation Comments: This note initiates
the study of what might be called the pure theory of control. Restricting
attention to linear, stationary, single input/single output plants,
the new concepts of controllability and observability are introduced
and it follows that solutions of the usual problems of control theory
exist if and only if the plant is completely controllable and completely
observable. The connection between observability and controllability
is formalized by the Duality Principle, which shows that the Wiener
filtering and prediction problem is a special case of the author's
theory of optimization of deterministic control systems, as has been
shown earlier by less direct methods. },

using a UAV with fixed airspeed. Two different types of trajectories
are developed: sinusoidal and loiter trajectories. The selection
between the two types of trajectories is based on the ration (sigma)
between the ground target speed and the UAV speed. Loiter mode is
selected when the ground vehicle is moving slowly compared to the
air vehicle. Otherwise, the sinusoidal mode is selected.

A wind estimation scheme (not described) is used to compensate for
wind.

Experimental results are presented. The results are obtained using
the Cloudcap Piccolo autopilot.

Applications include convoy support and over-the-horizon surveillance
and reconnaisance.

Weakness: (1) Do not account directly for heading rate constraints.
(2) Do not explicitly show that tracking is guaranteed. (3) Do not
include multiple vehicles. (4) Wind compensation scheme is not well

@article{GrisettiStachnissBurgard09,
	abstract = {Abstract---Learning models of the environment is one of the

fundamental tasks of mobile robots since maps are needed for a

wide range of robotic applications, such as navigation and transportation

tasks, service robotic applications, and several others.

In the past, numerous efficient approaches to map learning have

been proposed.Most of them, however, assume that the robot lives

on a plane. In this paper, we present a highly efficient maximumlikelihood

approach that is able to solve 3-D and 2-D problems.

Our approach addresses the so-called graph-based formulation of

simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and can be seen as

an extension of Olson's algorithm toward non-flat environments.

It applies a novel parameterization of the nodes of the graph that

significantly improves the performance of the algorithm and can

cope with arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us to

bound the complexity of the algorithm to the size of the mapped

area and not to the length of the trajectory. Furthermore, our

approach is able to appropriately distribute the roll, pitch, and

yaw error over a sequence of poses in 3-D mapping problems. We

implemented our technique and compared it with multiple other

graph-based SLAM solutions. As we demonstrate in simulated

and real-world experiments, our method converges faster than the

other approaches and yields accurate maps of the environment.},

estimated distribution is compared to a previously generated map of the

uncertainty in the localization. This approach can be used to generate a

by using fixed on-off reaction jets. The control law for the flywheels
takes the form of a linear combination of functions of the state,
each positively homogeneous of degree 2p-1 (p{\textgreater}1/2); whereas the control
law for the reaction jets is of bang-bang form. The range (of the

with regard to flywheel saturation constraints. Finally, a control

based guidance control laws. A Lyapunov function is introduced for
the guidance law and two different nonlinear control laws are derived,
one based on quickest descent of the Lyapunov function, and the other
based on steepest descent of the Lyapunov function. The method would
be conducive to Will Curtis's satisficing control paradigm. The two
control laws are compared to standard proportional navigation and
augmented proportional navigation. In the simulations presented in
the paper, the results of the nonlinear guidance law are better than
the results of proportional navigation. The key advantage of the
technique is that it does not use the line-of-sight rate for the
guidance law. Instead, it uses the aspect angle of the target. },

mobile robots coordination nonholonomic robots reachability graphs
Comments: This is a nice paper on using virtual structures for formation
control. The basic idea is to treat the formation as a virtual structure,
with the desired positions of the robots as points within the virtual
structure. A formal definition of a virtual structure is given. The
control algorithm operates by first moving the virtual structure
(VS), then moving the robots to conform the the VS, and finally least
square fitting the virtual structure to the final robot positions.
Feedback to the formation is thereby explicitly encoded into the
algorithm. Another clever idea presented in the paper is that of
reachability graphs for mobile robots. The nodes of possible VS positions
are constrained to lie within the reachability graphs of each, thereby
ensuring that the required motion of each robot is feasible. Several
simulation and experimental scenarios are described including translation,
rotation, robot failure and docking. Formation errors on the order
of 1cm are obtained. The paper also contains a nice literature survey,

	abstract = {Abstract---We propose a semi-direct monocular visual odometry
algorithm that is precise, robust, and faster than current
state-of-the-art methods. The semi-direct approach eliminates
the need of costly feature extraction and robust matching
techniques for motion estimation. Our algorithm operates
directly on pixel intensities, which results in subpixel precision
at high frame-rates. A probabilistic mapping method that
explicitly models outlier measurements is used to estimate 3D
points, which results in fewer outliers and more reliable points.
Precise and high frame-rate motion estimation brings increased
robustness in scenes of little, repetitive, and high-frequency
texture. The algorithm is applied to micro-aerial-vehicle stateestimation
in GPS-denied environments and runs at 55 frames
per second on the onboard embedded computer and at more
than 300 frames per second on a consumer laptop. We call our
approach SVO (Semi-direct Visual Odometry) and release our
implementation as open-source software.},

obvious advantages in many applications, from automatic driving to

by consistent geometric matching of their features. Out-of-sequence

vocabulary tree to propose candidate views, and a strong geometric
filter to eliminate false positives: essentially, the robot continually
re-recognizes where it is. We present experiments showing the utility
of the approach on video data, including incremental map building
in large indoor and outdoor environments, map building without localization,

and resolve the inverse problem of optimal control theory, which
is the following: Given a control law, find all performance indices
for which this control law is optimal.

Under the assumptions of (a) linear constant plant, (b) linear constant
control law, (c) measurable state vvariables, (d) quadratic loss
functions with constant coefficients, (e) single control variable,
we give a complete analysis of this problem and obtain various explicit
conditions for the optimality of a given control law. An interesting
feature of the analysis is the central role of frequency-domain concepts,
which have been ignored in optimal control theory until very recently.
The discussion is presented in rigorous mathematical form.

The central conclusion is the following: A stable control law is
optimal if and only if the absolute value of the corresponding return
difference is at least equal to one at all frequencies. This provides
a beautifully simple connecting link between modern control theory
and the classical point of view which regards feedback as a means
of reducing component variations. },

	abstract = { {{\%}} from conclusions of the paper This paper proposed a new Lyapunov
function candidate suitable for the synthesis of guidance laws, which
are free of singularities, and for the analysis of missile-target
system stability taking into account the whole state, namely LOS
angle, LOS rate, and relative missile-target range. The paper proposed
nonlinear guidance laws for two classes of target maneuvers: 1) no
maneuver and 2) maneuvering target with delayed estimates of target
acceleration available to the guidance law. It was shown that uniform
ultimate boundedness of the missile-target system state is obtained
in the case of highly maneuvering targets. For a nonmaneuvering target,
asymptotic stability was demonstrated. Numerical simulations showed
that the nonlinear guidance laws proposed in this paper result in
improved performance when compared with PNG. In this paper, the flight
control system dynamics were assumed to be ideal. However, it is
known that system lags result in miss distances, and therefore the
work presented in this paper is currently being extended to the synthesis
of a more sophisticated nonlinear guidance law that takes into account
uncertain missile dynamics. },

	abstract = {In this paper we present a prototype system for image based localization in urban environments. Given a database of views of city street scenes tagged by GPS locations, the system computes the GPS location of a novel query view. We first use a wide-baseline matching technique based on SIFT features to select the closest views in the database. Often due to a large change of viewpoint and presence of repetitive structures, a large percentage of matches ({\&}gt; 50{\%}) are not correct correspondences. The subsequent motion estimation between the query view and the reference view, is then handled by a novel and efficient robust estimation technique capable of dealing with large percentage of outliers. This stage is also accompanied by a model selection step among the fundamental matrix and the homography. Once the motion between the closest reference views is estimated, the location of the query view is then obtained by triangulation of translation directions. Approximate solutions for cases when triangulation cannot be obtained reliably are also described. The presented system is tested on the dataset used in ICCV 2005 Computer Vision Contest and is shown to have higher accuracy than previous reported results.},

attention on power systems after a symmetrical 3-phase short circuit

3D. The results is compared to pure proportional navigation and shown
to be much better. However, I do not think that the comparison is

strategy. Second, since we assume that the motion of the target is
known to the interceptor, it would be more appropriate to compare
OGL to augmented proportional navigation which uses this information
and also guarantees that the acceleration goes to zero at intercept.

feedback control is presented. Its main advantage is that the gains in
the control law are selected on the basis of information concerning the
input (control) signal only (its previous values, its constraints,

overcomes the problem of most existing control methodologies which first
evaluate a model of the robot dynamics and then incorporate elements of
that model in a control law. This increases computational complexity.
The strategy brings simple, model-free, effective algorithms that

From a single camera on the UAV, the 3D structure of its surrounding environment, including any obstacles, can be estimated from motion parallax using a technique called structure from motion. Most structure from motion algorithms attempt to reconstruct the 3D structure of the environment from a single optical flow value at each feature point. We present a novel method for calculating structure from motion that does not require a precise calculation of optical flow at each feature point. Due to the effects of image noise and the aperture problem, it may be impossible to accurately calculate a single optical flow value at each feature point. Instead we may only be able to calculate a set of likely optical flow values and their associated probabilities or an optical flow probability distribution. Using this probability distribution, a more robust method for calculating structure from motion is developed. This method is being developed for use on a UAV to detect obstacles, but it can be used on any vehicle where obstacle avoidance is needed.},

a simple fashion using Cartesian coordinates. Unfortunately, in most

situation requires either converting the measurements to a Cartesian
frame of reference and working directly on converted measurements or
using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) in mixed coordinates. An accurate
means of tracking with debiased consistent converted measurements which
accounts for the sensor inaccuracies over all practical geometries and
accuracies is presented. This method is compared with the mixed
coordinates EKF approach as well as a previous converted measurement
approach which is an acceptable approximation only for moderate
cross-range errors. The new approach is shown to be more accurate in
terms of position and velocity errors and provides consistent estimates
(i.e., compatible with the filter calculated covariances) for all
practical situations. The combination of parameters (range, range
accuracy, and azimuth accuracy) for which debiasing is needed is

	abstract = {Abstract This paper describes a new approach for autonomous road following
for an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) using a visual sensor. A road is
defined as any continuous, extended, curvilinear feature, which can
include city streets, highways, and dirt roads, as well as forest-fire
perimeters, shorelines, and fenced borders. To achieve autonomous
road-following, this paper utilizes Proportional Navigation as the
basis for the guidance law, where visual information is directly
fed back into the controller. The tracking target for the Proportional
Navigation algorithm is chosen as the position on the edge of the
camera frame at which the road flows into the image. Therefore, each
frame in the video stream only needs to be searched on the edge of
the frame, thereby significantly reducing the computational requirements
of the computer vision algorithms. The tracking error defined in
the camera reference frame shows that the Proportional Navigation
guidance law results in a steadystate error caused by bends and turns
in the road, which are perceived as road motion. The guidance algorithm
is therefore adjusted using Augmented Proportional NavigationGuidance
to account for the perceived road accelerations and to force the
steady-state error to zero. The effectiveness of the solution is
demonstrated through high-fidelity simulations, and with flight tests
using a small autonomous UAV.},

bank angle. On-line learning neural networks are implemented to compensate
the control effectiveness decrease and guarantee the robustness to
the uncertainties due to aerodynamic coefficients variations. The
main feature of the proposed controller is that the adaptive controller
is designed by assuming that all of the nonlinear functions of the
system have uncertainties, whereas most of the previous works assume
that only some of the nonlinear functions are unknown. Neural networks
learn through the weight update rules that are derived from the Lyapunov
control theory. The closed-loop stability of the error states is
also investigated. A nonlinear dynamic model of a high performance

landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on an exact

factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional

@article{DingWangRizos07,
	abstract = {The central task of GPS/INS integration is to effectively blend GPS
and INS data together

to generate an optimal solution. The present data fusion algorithms,
which are mostly based

on Kalman filtering (KF), have several limitations. One of those limitations
is the stringent

requirement on precise a priori knowledge of the system models and
noise properties.

Uncertainty in the covariance parameters of the process noise (Q)
and the observation

errors (R) may significantly degrade the filtering performance. The
conventional way of

determining Q and R relies on intensive analysis of empirical data.
However, the noise levels

may change in different applications. Over the past few decades adaptive
KF algorithms

have been intensively investigated with a view to reducing the influence
of the Q and R

definition errors. The covariance matching method has been shown to
be one of the most

promising techniques. This paper first investigates the utilization
of an online stochastic

modelling algorithm with regards to its parameter estimation stability,
convergence, optimal

window size, and the interaction between Q and R estimations. Then
a new adaptive process

noise scaling algorithm is proposed. Without artificial or empirical
parameters being used,

the proposed adaptive mechanism has demonstrated the capability of
autonomously tuning

the process noise covariance to the optimal magnitude, and hence improving
the overall

filtering performance.},

To explicitly address the obstacle initialization problem, the maps are parameterized using the inverse time-to-collision (TTC), which is independent of the ground speed of the MAV. Using bearing-only measurements, an extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is employed to estimate the inverse TTC, azimuth, and elevation to obstacles. A nonlinear observability analysis is used to derive conditions for the observability of the system. Based on these conditions, we design a path planning algorithm that minimizes the estimation uncertainties while simultaneously avoiding collisions with obstacles. The behavior of the planning algorithm is analyzed and the characteristics of the environment in which the planning algorithm guarantees collision-free paths for MAVs are described. Numerical results show that the proposed method is successful in solving the path planning problem for MAVs.},

	abstract = {Flying ?xed-wing miniature air vehicles (FW-MAVs) in urban terrain
is a challenging

task because of unstructured urban environments, the minimum speed
requirement for

?ight of ?xed-wing vehicles, and the non-holonomic characteristics
of FW-MAVs. While

traditional path-planning algorithms can e?ectively overcome many
of these constraints,

if the FW-MAV detects new obstacles in-?ight that were not included
in the initial path-

planning, immediate action must be taken to avoid collision. Re-planning
with traditional

path-planning algorithms is not feasible due to the time required
to plan an entire path.

Therefore, a reactive collision avoidance system must be used to guarantee
obstacle avoid-

ance until a new path can be planned which includes the newly sensed
information.

In this paper we develop a reactive nonlinear collision avoidance
guidance law for FW-

MAVs ?ying in urban terrain. Our guidance law is designed for the
scenario where a wall

or other large object is observed. In this case, we would like the
FW-MAV to maintain a

speci?ed safe distance away from the obstacle over time. The algorithm
is developed using

Lyapunov stability theory, relative geometry between the FW-MAV and
the obstacle, and

sliding-mode theory. The FW-MAV reacts given the range information
between the FW-

MAV and the obstacle at a constant bearing. We show that our guidance
law guarantees

the convergence of distance between the FW-MAV and the obstacle to
the desired safe

distance. Simulation results show that the guidance law is successful
in navigating the

FW-MAV between zigzag walls, non parallel walls, curved walls, and
avoids sharp corners

	abstract = {This paper presents a vision-aided uniformly semi-globally exponentially stable (USGES)
nonlinear observer for estimation of attitude, gyro bias, position, velocity and specic force
of a xed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The nonlinear observer uses measure-
ments from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) receiver, and a video camera. This paper presents a nonlinear observer representa-
tion with a computer vision (CV) system without any assumptions related to the distance
to objects in the images and the structure of the terrain being recorded. The CV utilizes
a camera and the continuous epipolar constraint to calculate body-xed linear velocity.
The observer is named a Continuous Epipolar Optical Flow (CEOF) nonlinear observer.
Experimental data from a UAV test 
ight and simulated data are presented showing that
the CEOF nonlinear observer has robust performance. Experimental results are compared
with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and illustrate that the estimates of the states con-
verge to the correct values. Results show that using the proposed CV in addition to IMU
and GNSS improves the accuracy of the estimates. The CV provides accurate informa-
tion about the direction of travel of the UAV, which improves the attitude and gyro bias
estimate.},

The optical flow computation is interesting because it uses both SURF features, and also template matching.

The key idea is to use the epipolar constraint in the derivation of the nonlinear observer. Unfortunately the derivation of the observer equations is not very insightful. Also, I wonder about the fact that the observer for the rotation matrix is not constrained to SO(3).

	abstract = {  Consensus algorithms for networked dynamic systems provide scalable algorithms for sensor fusion in sensor networks. This paper introduces a distributed filter that allows the nodes of a sensor network to track the average of n sensor measurements using an average consensus based distributed filter called consensus filter. This consensus filter plays a crucial role in solving a data fusion problem that allows implementation of a scheme for distributed Kalman filtering in sensor networks. The analysis of the convergence, noise propagation reduction, and ability to track fast signals are provided for consensus filters. As a byproduct, a novel critical phenomenon is found that relates the size of a sensor network to its tracking and sensor fusion capabilities. We characterize this performance limitation as a tracking uncertainty principle. This answers a fundamental question regarding how large a sensor network must be for effective sensor fusion. Moreover, regular networks emerge as efficient topologies for distributed fusion of noisy information. Though, arbitrary overlay networks can be used. Simulation results are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of consensus filters for distributed sensor fusion. },

the future of aviation safety. Before new technologies on board

manned or unmanned aircraft are deployed, rigorous analysis

using encounter simulations is required to prove system

robustness. These simulations rely on models that accurately

reflect the geometries and dynamics of aircraft encounters at

close range. These types of encounter models have been

developed by several organizations since the early 1980s. Lincoln

Laboratory's newer encounter models, however, provide a

higher-fidelity representation of encounters, are based on

substantially more data, leverage a theoretical framework for

finding optimal model structures, and reflect recent changes in

the airspace.

Three categories of encounter model were developed by Lincoln

Laboratory. Two of these categories are used for modeling

conventional aircraft; one involving encounters with prior air

traffic control intervention and one without. The third category

of encounter model is for encounters with unconventional

aircraft---such as gliders, skydivers, balloons, and airships---that

typically do not carry transponders. Together, these encounter

models are being used to examine the safety and effectiveness of

aircraft collision avoidance systems and as a foundation for

algorithms for future manned and unmanned systems.},

Also this method does not require excessive online computations like
the recently popular state dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) technique.
Furthermore, it provides a closed-form non-linear feedback controller

Cameras can be mounted on-board of the unmanned vehicles for the purpose of scientific data gathering, surveillance for law enforcement and homeland security, as well as to provide visual information to detect and avoid imminent collisions for autonomous navigation. However, most current computer vision algorithms are highly complex computationally and usually constitute the bottleneck of the guidance and control loop. In this paper, we present a novel computer vision algorithm for collision detection and time-to-impact calculation based on feature density distribution (FDD) analysis. It does not require accurate feature extraction, tracking, or estimation of focus of expansion (FOE). Under a few reasonable assumptions, by calculating the expansion rate of the FDD in space, time-to-impact can be accurately estimated. A sequence of monocular images is studied, and different features are used simultaneously in FDD analysis to show that our algorithm can achieve a fairly good accuracy in collision detection. In this paper we also discuss reactive path planning and trajectory generation techniques that can be accomplished without violating the velocity and heading rate constraints of the UAV.},

a fleet of vehicles is controllable. The condition depends upon the

gives an example of controlling the mean and standard variation of
a group of AUVs. The mean and standard variation act as the coordination
variable for the system, although they don't call it that. The structure
described in the paper fits very well into our centralized coordinated

general structure. The solution of the problem is shown to be related
to the existence of solutions of a pair of Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities

the control. The example at the end of the paper uses the perturbation
method developed by Albrekht and Lukes to approximate the HJI equations.

@article{Smoot2012,
	abstract = {Motivated by recent commercial development of airborne wind energy, the conceptual design of tethered platforms is investigated. Airborne wind energy focuses on harvesting power from wind through nontraditional methods. Some of the ideas include commercial scale electric turbines for the upper atmosphere, using tow devices to assist in shipping or portable light wind generators. Different from current turbines, these systems do not have large masts and blades but instead use a tethered flying body to transmit energy. The vehicle at the end of the tether varies depending on the energy harvesting method but all fall under the broader category of the towed body. In contrast to modeling and analysis techniques specifically tailored to evaluate performance of individual types of towed bodies, a methodology for designing efficient, stable wings for towed bodies is developed. Static performance can be characterized by a minimal set of design parameters. This minimal set is derived through dimensional analysis showing that the static performance is dependent on a minimum of 3 parameters. These are chosen to be the ratios of effective lift to drag of the end vehicle, tether cross-flow drag to tether weight and effective lift to tether cross-flow drag. An experiment was performed to verify that two systems of different sizes with matching dimensionless design parameters would have similar dimensionless performance. To demonstrate the kind of design analysis that can be done, altitude is chosen as an example performance goal. Sensitivity studies show that for all the design parameters, there are value regions that are highly sensitive to changes in design parameter and areas that are flat. This means that increasing the effective lift to drag ratio beyond a certain threshold, for example, will give small increases in altitude. While the performance analysis is for generic towed bodies, the stability analysis focuses on rigid wings. Although similar to aircraft, attaching a tether to a flying object increases the amount of information to track and drastically alters modal and stability characteristics. By adapting some airplane analysis techniques to tethered systems the design complexity has been reduced, facilitating intuitive understanding for conceptual design. Static stability criteria is established similar to that of unrestrained aircraft, demonstrating the effect of bridling on static stability. Terms that relate trim and static stability are derived. A simple linear model is also developed for quick evaluation of stability. Stability derivatives from unrestrained aircraft analysis are combined with tether derivatives that give the change in tether force at the attachment point only. The linear model has 12 modes, 6 for the translation degrees of freedom and 6 for the rotational degrees of freedom. A method is presented for determining an optimal performance design. This is done by forming a constrained optimization problem to minimize the cost. The method is demonstrated in the design of a kite to break the single-line kite altitude record. The cost function includes estimates of tether cost and the price of materials for kite construction. Constraints include limits on aerodynamic and structural characteristics along with performance constraints such as required altitude. A stable planform and bridle position are then chosen using the analysis tools developed. Although a full scale design is not built, a sub-scale model, scaled according to the rules derived in the thesis, is flown to demonstrate the feasibility of the design. Using this methodology, parameter studies for environmental inputs and material properties are done for the optimized system.},

@article{Stolle2003,
	abstract = {An Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (UAV) is equipped with a nose-mounted camera capable of pan and tilt rotation for the observation of ground targets. The two camera angles are adjusted automatically in order to keep the target in the camera's field of view. While the camera actuators are fast enough to keep up with vehicle motion, the limited range of the camera angles leads to the target getting out of sight. Therefore, target exposure is affected by wind. Furthermore, the relative position of the sun can lead to glare and image overexposure. While the effect of wind can be improved by commanding a sideslip angle, image overexposure is avoided by keeping the vehicle between sun and target. Thus, it is desirable of define maneuvers that result in maximum target exposure, and provide guidance laws to allow path following for these maneuvers. This paper presents initial results, obtained based on circular and elliptical maneuvers. The results were generated using an accurate non-linear Aerosonde UAV representation and environmental dynamic models. Simulated GPS data was used for the path following guidance. The complete path about the target at constant altitude and airspeed is specified simply by the desired orbital segment and course reversals at the segment boundaries. With camera pan limited to the forward 180{\&}deg;, this can achieve long term observation. A camera with minor 'look-back' range can provide continuous observation in a maneuver that employs both circular and elliptical segments.},

produced total upward aerodynamic force. Then we visualized air flow

that free body motion caused a stable attachment of leading edge

An approach is proposed in this paper to treat well clear as a separation standard, thus posing it as a relative state between aircraft where the risk of collision first reaches an unacceptable level. By this approach, an analytically- derived boundary for well clear can be derived that supports rigorous safety assessment. A preliminary boundary is proposed in both time and distance for the well clear separation standard, and recommendations for future work are made.},

a notion of group flatness, which is simply differential flatness
for a group of vehicles. Formation constraints are introduced as
intervehicle constraints. Two types of control laws are used to track
the resulting flat trajectories: (1) feedforward (open loop) trajectories
and then recompute every two seconds. (2)lqr for tracking flat trajectories:
regenerate trajectories every 2.5 seconds.

The introduction of formation maneuvers is somewhat awkward, and
even though the planned trajectories are collision free, the actual
trajectories may collide.

This is also something that we should be able to integrate into our
approach.},

@article{WebbPrazenicaKurdilaKind07,
	abstract = { The realization of vision-based, autonomous flight for micro air
vehicles presents numerous technical challenges in diverse fields
such as image processing, trajectory planning, control theory, and
microhardware design. This paper explores one aspect of the overall
problem: robust, real-time estimation of aircraft states from a set
of tracked feature points. This vision-based approach is realized
via an implementation of the implicit extended Kalman filter, a variation
of the classical Kalman filter that allows for nonlinear dynamic
models and updates from measurements that are implicit functions
of the state variables. The epipolar constraint, which is a geometric
relationship between the feature point position vectors and the camera
translation vector, is employed in this paper as the implicit measurement
in the Kalman filter. In order for the vison-based Kalman filter
to provide reliable state estimation, it must be robust with respect
to modeling errors in the dynamic propagator. This is especially
true because the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on a micro
air vehicle are frequently not known to a high degree of accuracy.
Furthermore, the algorithm must be robust with respect to noise in
the measured feature point positions in the image plane. This paper
explores both of these robustness issues using results from a micro
air vehicle simulation model developed at the NASA Langley Research
Center. In particular, a hierarchy of dynamic models, ranging from
a random walk model to a high-fidelity nonlinear micro air vehicle
model, is employed in the Kalman filter for a simulated micro air
vehicle trajectory with varying levels of measurement noise. It is
demonstrated that the visionbased measurement updates in the filter
are capable of compensating for significant modeling errors and filter
initialization errors. As would be expected, superior overall results
are achieved using higher-fidelity dynamic models in the Kalman filter.
The work presented in this paper represents the first step toward
the ultimate objective of incorporating vision-based state estimation
into the design of autonomous flight control systems for micro air
vehicles operating in urban environments. },

The basis of the proposed technique is a method for the determination

@article{Luo06,
	abstract = {An essential determinant of the value of surrogate digital images
is their quality. Image quality measurement has become crucial for
most image processing applications. Over the past years, there have
been many attempts to develop models or metrics for image quality
that incorporate elements of human visual sensitivity. However, there
is no current standard and objective definition of spectral image
quality. This paper proposes a reliable automatic method for objective
image quality measurement by local spatial-frequency wavelet analysis.
The analysis is performed locally by dividing an image into 64664
pixel blocks, and transforming the data into wavelet domain and sub-band
image domain. A fast lifting wavelet algorithm is developed for computationally
efficient spatialfrequency deconstruction of images to extract the
features of edges in sub-band datasets. Wavelet analysis throughout
the spatial-frequency range with respect to noise, sharpness, brightness,
contrast, and modulation transfer function (MTF) reveals more detailed
information to relate the quality of an image to the interpretation
by using an artificial neural network to optimize weightings and
results in a promising quantitative measure of image quality. Experimental
results from using this method for image quality measurement exhibit
good correlation to subjective visual quality assessments. The proposed
approach with fast computation provides a potential metric for reliable
image quality quantification, allowing image quality to be automatically
evaluated following image capture/compression, but prior to permanent
storage in a database.},

	abstract = { Keywords: optical flow structure from motion Comments: Several novel
structure from motion algorithms are presented which are designed
to more effectively manage the problem of noise. In many practical
applications, structure from motion algorithms fail to work properly
because of the noise in the optical flow values. Most structure from
motion algorithms implicitly assume that the noise is identically-distributed
and that the noise is white. Both assumptions are false. Some points
are easier to track than others and some points are easier to track
in a particular direction. The accuracy of each optical flow value
can be quantified using an optical flow probability distribution.
By using optical flow probability distributions in place of optical
flow estimates in a structure from motion algorithm, a better understanding
of the noise is developed and a more accurate solution is obtained.
Two different methods of calculating the optical flow probability
distributions are presented. The first calculates non-Gaussian probability
distributions and the second calculates Gaussian probability distributions.
Three different methods for calculating structure from motion are
presented which use these probability distributions. The first method
works on two frames and can handle any kind of noise. The second
method works on two frames and is restricted to only Gaussian noise.
The final method works on multiple frames and uses Gaussian noise.
A simulation was created to directly compare the performance of methods
which use optical flow probability distributions and methods which
do not. The simulation results show that those methods which use
the probability distributions better estimate the camera motion and
the structure of the scene. },

calculation in networks where communications between nodes

under the constraint that each node receives noisy transmissions

scheme for any node to calculate an unbiased estimate of an

arbitrary linear function of the initial values. Our scheme

consists of a linear iteration where, at each time-step, each

previous value and those of its neighbors. We show that after

repeating this process with almost any set of weights for a

finite number of time-steps (upper bounded by the size of the

network), any node in the network will be able to calculate

an unbiased estimate of any linear function by taking a linear

combination of the values that it sees over the course of the

linear iteration. Furthermore, for a given set of weights, we

describe how to choose this linear combination to minimize

the variance of the unbiased estimate calculated by each node.

A special case of our results is a solution to the distributed

odometry algorithm which, by directly using pixel
intensity errors of image patches, achieves accurate tracking

After detection, the tracking of the multilevel patch features is
closely coupled to the underlying extended Kalman filter (EKF)
by directly using the intensity errors as innovation term during
the update step. We follow a purely robocentric approach
where the location of 3D landmarks are always estimated
with respect to the current camera pose. Furthermore, we
decompose landmark positions into a bearing vector and
a distance parametrization whereby we employ a minimal
representation of differences on a corresponding -Algebra
in order to achieve better consistency and to improve the
computational performance. Due to the robocentric, inversedistance
landmark parametrization, the framework does not
require any initialization procedure, leading to a truly powerup-
and-go state estimation system. The presented approach is
successfully evaluated in a set of highly dynamic hand-held
experiments as well as directly employed in the control loop of

much less reliable. Reduce collision checks by only checking paths
that lead to goal, i.e., collisions are checked after feasible trajectory
is found. PUMA arms are used: myopic collision free paths are planned.
Coordination is achieved through planning the velocity profiles.

However, when in flight, many aircraft can{\$}\backslash{\$}nhandle larger loads, but this capability is rarely exploited. The{\$}\backslash{\$}npossibility of using an aircraft cable system to lift large payloads{\$}\backslash{\$}nis studied in this paper. This concept has been studied previously{\$}\backslash{\$}nfor single-aircraft, single-cable systems in some detail. The major{\$}\backslash{\$}nlimitation of such systems is the need to fly very tight circles{\$}\backslash{\$}nat high-lift coefficients. This limits the size of the payload that{\$}\backslash{\$}ncan be retrieved with such a system. To overcome this, it is possible{\$}\backslash{\$}nto employ a multiple-aircraft, multiple-cable system to allow greater{\$}\backslash{\$}ncontrol of the payload position as well as allowing a much wider{\$}\backslash{\$}nchoice of aircraft speed and lift coefficient. In this paper, an{\$}\backslash{\$}nobject-oriented cable modeling approach is used to study the relative{\$}\backslash{\$}nequilibria of such a system. Parametric studies of different payload{\$}\backslash{\$}nmasses and aircraft orbit parameters are presented, and the dynamic{\$}\backslash{\$}nstability is analyzed.

	abstract = {Hybrid systems which are capable of exhibiting simultaneously several kinds of dynamic behavior in different parts of a system (e.g., continuous-time dynamics, discrete-time dynamics, jump phenomena, switching and logic commands, and the like) are of great current interest. In the present paper we first formulate a model for hybrid dynamical systems which covers a very large class of systems and which is suitable for the qualitative analysis of such systems. Next, we introduce the notion of an invariant set (e.g., equilibrium) for hybrid dynamical systems and we define several types of (Lyapunov-like) stability concepts for an invariant set.We then establish sufficient conditions for uniform stability, uniform asymptotic stability, exponential stability, and instability of an invariant set of hybrid dynamical systems. Under some mild additional assumptions, we also establish necessary conditions for some of the above stability types (converse theorems). In addition to the above, we also establish sufficient conditions for the uniform boundedness of the motions of hybrid dynamical systems (Lagrange stability). To demonstrate the applicability of the developed theory, we present specific examples of hybrid dynamical systems and we conduct a stability analysis of some of these examples (a class of sampled- data feedback control systems with a nonlinear (continuous-time) plant and a linear (discrete-time) controller, and a class of systems with impulse effects).},

Systems, Infinite Dimensional Linear systems Comments: Control of
the distributed parameter systems (DPS) usually involves dynamical
descriptions on infinite-dimensional Hilbert or Banach spaces of
functions. For a linear stabilizable and detectable DPS, an infintie-dimesional
feedback controller exists so that the closed-loop system is stable.
However, this infinite-dimensional controller generally cannot be
implemented with practical computers and devices. Consequently, the
reduced order modeling of DPS becomes extremely crucial for finite-dimensional
controller design. In this thesis, Galerkin (or finite element) mehtods
are presented as a way to develop finite-dimensional Galerkin controllers
by approximating the infinite-dimensional stabilizing controller
for a class of linear DPS. This investigation will give a very simple
sufficient condition, i.e. the test of nonsingularity of a matrix
for a finite-dimensional Galerkin feedback controller to perform
as well as the infinite-dimensional stabilizing controller. },

uncertainty ellipsoid measures the accuracy of the estimates. The point estimates and the uncertainty ellipsoids are propagated using a Lie
group variational integrator and its linearization, respectively. The attitude and angular velocity estimates are optimal in the sense that the sizes

(Kalman filters and particle filters are different instantiations of Bayesian filters.) An alternative approach is to represent the measurement noise using deterministic bounded uncertainties. Primarily for historical reasons, the bounded uncertainty approach has not been pursued and developed, other than in a few isolated papers. In this paper Dr. Sanyal derives an attitude estimation scheme based on bounded uncertainties, where the attitude is represented by a rotation matrix. The result is impressive in that not only is the algorithm derived, but a sufficient condition is also presented that guarantees asymptotic convergence of the estimation error. This is a new alternative to standard methods based on Bayes filters, and I believe that the importance of this paper will increase with time.},

In this paper, we present an innovative approach to quantify likely intruder trajectories and estimate the probability of collision risk for a pair of aircraft flying at the same altitude and in close proximity given the state estimates provided by an airborne radar sensor. The proposed approach is formulated in a probabilistic framework using the reachable set concept and the statistical data contained in the uncorrelated encounter model (UEM) developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to the problem of tracking when the source of the measurement data is uncertain. It is assumed that one object of interest ('target') is in track and a number of undesired returns are detected and resolved at a certain time in the neighbourhood of the predicted location of the target's return. A suboptimal estimation procedure that takes into account all the measurements that might have originated from the object in track but does not have growing memory and computational requirements is presented. The probability of each return (lying in a certain neighborhood of the predicted return, called 'validation region') being correct is obtained-this is called 'probabilistic data association' (PDA). The undesired returns are assumed uniformly and independently distributed. The estimation is done by using the PDA method with an appropriately modified tracking filter, called PDAF. Since the computational requirements of the PDAF are only slightly higher than those of the standard filter, the method can be useful for real-time systems. Simulation results obtained for tracking an object in a cluttered environment show the PDAF to give significantly better results than the standard filter currently in use for this type of problem. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

We show constraint-sensitive means of perturbing transformation matrices using their associated exponential-map generators and demonstrate these tools on three simple-yet-important estimation problems: 1) propagating uncertainty through a compound pose change, 2) fusing multiple measurements of a pose (e.g., for use in pose-graph relaxation), and 3) propagating uncertainty on poses (and landmarks) through a nonlinear camera model. The contribution of the paper is the presentation of the theoretical tools, which can be applied in the analysis of many problems involving 3-D pose and point variables. {\textcopyright} 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The nearest neighbor (NN) technique is very simple, highly efficient and effective in the field of pattern recognition, text categorization, object recognition etc. Its simplicity is its main advantage, but the disadvantages can't be ignored even. The memory requirement and computation complexity also matter. Many techniques are developed to overcome these limitations. NN techniques are broadly classified into structure less and structure based techniques. In this paper, we present the survey of such techniques. Weighted kNN, Model based kNN, Condensed NN, Reduced NN, Generalized NN are structure less techniques whereas k-d tree, ball tree, Principal Axis Tree, Nearest Feature Line, Tunable NN, Orthogonal Search Tree are structure based algorithms developed on the basis of kNN. The structure less method overcome memory limitation and structure based techniques reduce the computational complexity.},

We propose a new assumed density filter called continuous-discrete extended Kalman filter on Lie groups (CD-LG-EKF).

Such a distribution is parametrized by a mean and a covariance matrix defined on the Lie group and in its associated Lie algebra respectively. Our formalism yields tractable equations for both non-linear continuous time propagation and discrete update of the distribution parameters under the assumption that the posterior distribution of the state is a concentrated Gaussian. As a side effect, we contribute to the derivation of the first and second order differential of the matrix Lie group logarithm using left connection. We also show that the CD-LG-EKF reduces to the usual CD-EKF if the state and the observations evolve on Euclidean spaces. Our approach leads to a systematic methodology for the design of filters, which is illustrated by the application to a camera pose filtering problem with observations on Lie group. In this application, the CD-LG-EKF significantly outperforms two constrained non-linear filters (one based on a linearization technique and the other on the unscented transform) applied on the embedding space of the Lie group.},

ADAS commonly involve adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, lane change assistance, traffic sign recognition, and parking assistance---with the ultimate goal of producing a fully autonomous vehicle. The present paper addresses detection and tracking of moving objects within the context of ADAS. We use a multisensor setup consisting of a radar and a stereo camera mounted on top of a vehicle. We propose to model the sensors uncertainty in polar coordinates on Lie Groups and perform the objects state filtering on Lie groups, specifically, on the product of two special Euclidean groups, i.e., SE(2)2. To this end, we derive the designed filter within the framework of the extended Kalman filter on Lie groups. We assert that the proposed approach results with more accurate uncertainty modeling, since used sensors exhibit contrasting measurement uncertainty characteristics and the predicted target motions result with banana-shaped uncertainty contours. We believe that accurate uncertainty modeling is an important ADAS topic, especially when safety applications are concerned. To solve the multitarget tracking problem, we use the joint integrated probabilistic data association filter and present necessary modifications in order to use it on Lie groups. The proposed approach is tested on a real-world dataset collected with the described multisensor setup in urban traffic scenarios.},

@article{Long2013,
	abstract = {Distributions in position and orientation are central to many problems in robot localization. To increase efficiency, a majority of algorithms for planar mobile robots use Gaussians defined on positional Cartesian coordinates and heading. However, the distribution of poses for a noisy two-wheeled robot moving in the plane has been observed by many to be a "bananashaped" distribution, which is clearly not Gaussian/normal in these coordinates. As uncertainty increases, many localization algorithms therefore become "inconsistent" due to the normality assumption breaking down. We observe that this is because the combination of Cartesian coordinates and heading is not the most appropriate set of coordinates to use, and that the banana distribution can be described in closed form as a Gaussian in an alternative set of coordinates via the so-called exponential map. With this formulation, we can derive closed-form expressions for propagating the mean and covariance of the Gaussian in these exponential coordinates for a differential-drive car moving along a trajectory constructed from sections of straight segments and arcs of constant curvature. In addition, we detail how to fuse two or more Gaussians in exponential coordinates together with given relative pose measurements between robots moving in formation. These propagation and fusion formulas utilized here reduce uncertainty in localization better than when using traditional methods. We demonstrate with numerical examples dramatic improvements in the estimated pose of three robots moving in formation when compared to classical Cartesiancoordinate-based Gaussian fusion methods.},

Early pose uncertainty characterization methods proposed by Smith, Self, and Cheeseman (SCC), used coordinate-based first-order methods to propagate uncertainty through non-linear functions such as pose composition (head-to-tail), pose inversion, and relative pose extraction (tail-to-tail). Characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra of the special Euclidean group results in better uncertainty estimates. However, existing approaches assume that individual poses are independent. Since factors in a pose graph induce correlation, this independence assumption is usually not reflected in reality. In addition, prior work has focused primarily on the pose composition operation. This paper develops a framework for modeling the uncertainty of jointly distributed poses and describes how to perform the equivalent of the SSC pose operations while characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra. Evaluation on simulated and open-source datasets shows that the proposed methods result in more accurate uncertainty estimates. An accompanying C++ library implementation is also released.},

The Lagrangian formulation also ex presses the dynamics in terms of these Lie algebraic operations and leads to a particularly simple set of closed-form equations, in which the kinematic and inertial parameters appear explic itly and independently of each other. The geometric approach permits a high-level, coordinate-free view of robot dynamics that shows explicitly some of the connections with the larger body of work in mathematics and physics. At the same time the resulting equations are shown to be computationally ef fective and easily differentiated and factored with respect to any of the robot parameters.

	abstract = {A Lie group is an old mathematical abstract object dating back to the XIX century, when mathematician Sophus Lie laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. As it often happens, its usage has spread over diverse areas of science and technology many years later. In robotics, we are recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the fields of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation. Yet for a vast majority of roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract constructions and therefore difficult to understand and to use. This may be due to the fact that most of the literature on Lie theory is written by and for mathematicians and physicists, who might be more used than us to the deep abstractions this theory deals with. In estimation for robotics it is often not necessary to exploit the full capacity of the theory, and therefore an effort of selection of materials is required. In this paper, we will walk through the most basic principles of the Lie theory, with the aim of conveying clear and useful ideas, and leave a significant corpus of the Lie theory behind. Even with this mutilation, the material included here has proven to be extremely useful in modern estimation algorithms for robotics, especially in the fields of SLAM, visual odometry, and the like. Alongside this micro Lie theory, we provide a chapter with a few application examples, and a vast reference of formulas for the major Lie groups used in robotics, including most jacobian matrices and the way to easily manipulate them. We also present a new C++ template-only library implementing all the functionality described here.},

	abstract = {Error propagation on the Euclidean motion group arises in a number of areas such as errors that accumulate from the base to the distal end of manipulators. We address error propagation in rigid-body poses in a coordinate-free way, and explain how this differs from other approaches proposed in the literature. In this paper, we show that errors propagate by convolution on the Euclidean motion group, SE(3). When local errors are small, they can be described well as distributions on the Lie algebra se(3). We show how the concept of a highly concentrated Gaussian distribution on SE(3) is equivalent to one on se(3). We also develop closure relations for these distributions under convolution on SE(3). Numerical examples illustrate how convolution is a valuable tool for computing the propagation of both small and large errors. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},
